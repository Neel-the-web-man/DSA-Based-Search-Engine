Letf(x)be the number of zeroes at the end ofx!. Recall thatx! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * xand by convention,0! = 1.For example,f(3) = 0because3! = 6has no zeroes at the end, whilef(11) = 2because11! = 39916800has two zeroes at the end.Given an integerk, return the number of non-negative integersxhave the property thatf(x) = k.Example 1:Input:k = 0Output:5Explanation:0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with k = 0 zeroes.Example 2:Input:k = 5Output:0Explanation:There is no x such that x! ends in k = 5 zeroes.Example 3:Input:k = 3Output:5Constraints:0 <= k <= 109
