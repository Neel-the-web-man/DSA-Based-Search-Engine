There is a city composed ofn x nblocks, where each block contains a single building shaped like a vertical square prism. You are given a0-indexedn x ninteger matrixgridwheregrid[r][c]represents theheightof the building located in the block at rowrand columnc.A city'sskylineis theÂ outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the city from a distance. Theskylinefrom each cardinal direction north, east, south, and west may be different.We are allowed to increase the height ofany number of buildings by any amount(the amount can be different per building). The height of a0-height building can also be increased. However, increasing the height of a building shouldnotaffect the city'sskylinefrom any cardinal direction.Returnthemaximum total sumthat the height of the buildings can be increased bywithoutchanging the city'sskylinefrom any cardinal direction.Example 1:Input:grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]Output:35Explanation:The building heights are shown in the center of the above image.
The skylines when viewed from each cardinal direction are drawn in red.
The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:
gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
            [7, 4, 7, 7],
            [9, 4, 8, 7],
            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]Example 2:Input:grid = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]Output:0Explanation:Increasing the height of any building will result in the skyline changing.Constraints:n == grid.lengthn == grid[r].length2 <= n <= 500 <= grid[r][c] <= 100
