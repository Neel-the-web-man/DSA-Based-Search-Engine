You are given an undirected graph defined by an integern, the number of nodes, and a 2D integer arrayedges, the edges in the graph, whereedges[i] = [ui, vi]indicates that there is anundirectededge betweenuiandvi. You are also given an integer arrayqueries.Letincident(a, b)be defined as thenumber of edgesthat are connected toeithernodeaorb.The answer to thejthquery is thenumber of pairsof nodes(a, b)that satisfybothof the following conditions:a < bincident(a, b) > queries[j]Returnan arrayanswerssuch thatanswers.length == queries.lengthandanswers[j]is the answer of thejthquery.Note that there can bemultiple edgesbetween the same two nodes.Example 1:Input:n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,3],[2,3],[2,1]], queries = [2,3]Output:[6,5]Explanation:The calculations for incident(a, b) are shown in the table above.
The answers for each of the queries are as follows:
- answers[0] = 6. All the pairs have an incident(a, b) value greater than 2.
- answers[1] = 5. All the pairs except (3, 4) have an incident(a, b) value greater than 3.Example 2:Input:n = 5, edges = [[1,5],[1,5],[3,4],[2,5],[1,3],[5,1],[2,3],[2,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5]Output:[10,10,9,8,6]Constraints:2 <= n <= 2 * 1041 <= edges.length <= 1051 <= ui, vi<= nui!= vi1 <= queries.length <= 200 <= queries[j] < edges.length
