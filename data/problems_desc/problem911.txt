Each command moves the robot some distance up, down, left or right.The robot will stop when it has performed all commands, or immediately when it returns to a point that it has already visited. Your task is to calculate the total distance the robot moves.InputThe first line has an integernnn: the number of commands.After that, there arennnlines describing the commands. Each line has a characterdddand an integerxxx: the robot moves the distancexxxto the directionddd. Each direction is U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right).OutputPrint the total distance the robot moves.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤x≤1061 \le x \le 10^61≤x≤106ExampleInput:5
