There is a group ofnpeople labeled from0ton - 1where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.You are given an arrayricherwherericher[i] = [ai, bi]indicates thataihas more money thanbiand an integer arrayquietwherequiet[i]is the quietness of theithperson. All the given data in richer arelogically correct(i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation wherexis richer thanyandyis richer thanxat the same time).Returnan integer arrayanswerwhereanswer[x] = yifyis the least quiet person (that is, the personywith the smallest value ofquiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the personx.Example 1:Input:richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]Output:[5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]Explanation:answer[0] = 5.
Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is not clear if they have more money than person 0.
answer[7] = 7.
Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7 (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7.
The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.Example 2:Input:richer = [], quiet = [0]Output:[0]Constraints:n == quiet.length1 <= n <= 5000 <= quiet[i] < nAll the values ofquietareunique.0 <= richer.length <= n * (n - 1) / 20 <= ai, bi< nai!= biAll the pairs ofricherareunique.The observations inricherare all logically consistent.
