Given an integer arraynums, returnthemaximum possible sumof elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.Example 1:Input:nums = [3,6,5,1,8]Output:18Explanation:Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).Example 2:Input:nums = [4]Output:0Explanation:Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.Example 3:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4,4]Output:12Explanation:Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 1041 <= nums[i] <= 104
