You are given an integer arraynumsand an integerx. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the arraynumsand subtract its value fromx. Note that thismodifiesthe array for future operations.Returntheminimum numberof operations to reducextoexactly0if it is possible, otherwise, return-1.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5Output:2Explanation:The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce x to zero.Example 2:Input:nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4Output:-1Example 3:Input:nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10Output:5Explanation:The optimal solution is to remove the last three elements and the first two elements (5 operations in total) to reduce x to zero.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 1041 <= x <= 109
