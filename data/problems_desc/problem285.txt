You havengardens, labeled from1ton, and an arraypathswherepaths[i] = [xi, yi]describes a bidirectional path between gardenxito gardenyi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.All gardens haveat most 3paths coming into or leaving it.Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.Returnanysuch a choice as an arrayanswer, whereanswer[i]is the type of flower planted in the(i+1)thgarden. The flower types are denoted1,2,3, or4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.Example 1:Input:n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]Output:[1,2,3]Explanation:Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].Example 2:Input:n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]Output:[1,2,1,2]Example 3:Input:n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]Output:[1,2,3,4]Constraints:1 <= n <= 1040 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104paths[i].length == 21 <= xi, yi<= nxi!= yiEvery garden hasat most 3paths coming into or leaving it.
