Consider ann×nn \times nn×ngrid whose squares may have traps. It is not allowed to move to a square with a trap.Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square. You can only move right or down.InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the size of the grid.After this, there arennnlines that describe the grid. Each line hasnnncharacters:.denotes an empty cell, and*denotes a trap.OutputPrint the number of paths modulo109+710^9+7109+7.Constraints1≤n≤10001 \le n \le 10001≤n≤1000ExampleInput:4
