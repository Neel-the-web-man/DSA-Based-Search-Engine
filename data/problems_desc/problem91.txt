Given an integer arraynumsof lengthnand an integertarget, find three integers innumssuch that the sum is closest totarget.Returnthe sum of the three integers.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.Example 1:Input:nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1Output:2Explanation:The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).Example 2:Input:nums = [0,0,0], target = 1Output:0Explanation:The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).Constraints:3 <= nums.length <= 500-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000-104<= target <= 104
