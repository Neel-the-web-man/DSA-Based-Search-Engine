You are given an array of integersarrand an integertarget.You have to findtwo non-overlapping sub-arraysofarreach with a sum equaltarget. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays isminimum.Returnthe minimum sum of the lengthsof the two required sub-arrays, or return-1if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.Example 1:Input:arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3Output:2Explanation:Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.Example 2:Input:arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7Output:2Explanation:Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.Example 3:Input:arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6Output:-1Explanation:We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.Constraints:1 <= arr.length <= 1051 <= arr[i] <= 10001 <= target <= 108
