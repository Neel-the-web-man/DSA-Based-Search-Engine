You are playing a game consisting ofnnnplanets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself).You start on a planet and then travel through teleporters until you reach a planet that you have already visited before.Your task is to calculate for each planet the number of teleportations there would be if you started on that planet.InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the number of planets. The planets are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.The second line hasnnnintegerst1,t2,…,tnt_1,t_2,\dots,t_nt1​,t2​,…,tn​: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter. It is possible thatti=it_i=iti​=i.OutputPrintnnnintegers according to the problem statement.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤ti≤n1 \le t_i \le n1≤ti​≤nExampleInput:5
