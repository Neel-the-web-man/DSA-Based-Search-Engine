You are givennnnsticks with lengthsa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\dots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​.
You must make exactlykkkcuts to the sticks, so that
the number of sticks becomesn+kn + kn+k.After making the cuts, the difference between the length of the longest and shortest sticks should be as small as possible. Your task is to compute the smallest possible difference for all amountsk=1,2,…,mk=1,2,\dots,mk=1,2,…,m.The cuts must keep the lengths of the sticks positive integers. You may assume that the sticks can be cutmmmtimes.InputThe first line contains two integersn,mn,mn,m: the number of sticks and the maximum number of cuts.The second line containsnnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\dots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​:
the lengths of the sticks.OutputPrint one line withmmmintegers: the smallest possible difference if exactlyk=1,2,…,mk=1,2,\dots,mk=1,2,…,mcuts are made.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤ai≤1091 \le a_i \le 10^91≤ai​≤109ExampleInput:3 3
