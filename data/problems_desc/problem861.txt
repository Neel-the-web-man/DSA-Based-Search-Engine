Consider a directed weighted graph havingnnnnodes andmmmedges. Your task is to calculate the minimum path length from node111to nodennnwith exactlykkkedges.InputThe first input line contains three integersnnn,mmmandkkk: the number of nodes and edges, and the length of the path. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Then, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line contains three integersaaa,bbbandccc: there is an edge from nodeaaato nodebbbwith weightccc.OutputPrint the minimum path length. If there are no such paths, print−1-1−1.Constraints1≤n≤1001 \le n \le 1001≤n≤1001≤m≤n(n−1)1 \le m \le n(n-1)1≤m≤n(n−1)1≤k≤1091 \le k \le 10^91≤k≤1091≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤c≤1091 \le c \le 10^91≤c≤109ExampleInput:3 4 8
