A cinema hasnrows of seats, numbered from 1 tonand there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.Given the arrayreservedSeatscontaining the numbers of seats already reserved, for example,reservedSeats[i] = [3,8]means the seat located in row3and labelled with8is already reserved.Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats.A four-person group occupies four adjacent seatsin one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.Example 1:Input:n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]Output:4Explanation:The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four groups, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one group.Example 2:Input:n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]Output:2Example 3:Input:n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]Output:4Constraints:1 <= n <= 10^91 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)reservedSeats[i].length == 21 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10AllreservedSeats[i]are distinct.
