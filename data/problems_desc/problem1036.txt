You havennncoins, each of which has a distinct weight.There are two stacks which are initially empty. On each step you move one coin to a stack. You never remove a coin from a stack.After each move, your task is to determine which stack is heavier (if we can be sure that either stack is heavier).InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the number of coins. The coins are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n. You know that coiniiiis always heavier than coini−1i-1i−1, but you don't know their exact weights.After this, there arennnlines that describe the moves. Each line has two integerscccandsss: move coincccto stacksss(1 = left, 2 = right).OutputAfter each move, print<if the right stack is heavier,>if the left stack is heavier, and?if we can't know which stack is heavier.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅105ExampleInput:3
2 1
3 2
1 1Output:>

?Explanation: After the last move, if the coins are[2,3,4][2,3,4][2,3,4], the left stack is heavier, but if the coins are[1,2,5][1,2,5][1,2,5], the right stack is heavier.
