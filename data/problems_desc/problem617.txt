Thecomplementof an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the0's to1's and all the1's to0's in its binary representation.For example, The integer5is"101"in binary and itscomplementis"010"which is the integer2.Given an integernum, returnits complement.Example 1:Input:num = 5Output:2Explanation:The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.Example 2:Input:num = 1Output:0Explanation:The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.Constraints:1 <= num < 231Note:This question is the same as 1009:https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
