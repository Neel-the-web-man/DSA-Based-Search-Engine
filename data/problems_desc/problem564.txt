You are given an array ofnstringsstrs, all of the same length.We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.For example, if we havestrs = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]and deletion indices{0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is["bef", "vyz"].Suppose we chose a set of deletion indicesanswersuch that after deletions, the final array has its elements inlexicographicorder (i.e.,strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2] <= ... <= strs[n - 1]). Returnthe minimum possible value ofanswer.length.Example 1:Input:strs = ["ca","bb","ac"]Output:1Explanation:After deleting the first column, strs = ["a", "b", "c"].
Now strs is in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2]).
We require at least 1 deletion since initially strs was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1.Example 2:Input:strs = ["xc","yb","za"]Output:0Explanation:strs is already in lexicographic order, so we do not need to delete anything.
Note that the rows of strs are not necessarily in lexicographic order:
i.e., it is NOT necessarily true that (strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ...)Example 3:Input:strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]Output:3Explanation:We have to delete every column.Constraints:n == strs.length1 <= n <= 1001 <= strs[i].length <= 100strs[i]consists of lowercase English letters.
