Suppose LeetCode will start itsIPOsoon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before theIPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at mostkdistinct projects before theIPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at mostkdistinct projects.You are givennprojects where theithproject has a pure profitprofits[i]and a minimum capital ofcapital[i]is needed to start it.Initially, you havewcapital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.Pick a list ofat mostkdistinct projects from given projects tomaximize your final capital, and returnthe final maximized capital.The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.Example 1:Input:k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]Output:4Explanation:Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.Example 2:Input:k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]Output:6Constraints:1 <= k <= 1050 <= w <= 109n == profits.lengthn == capital.length1 <= n <= 1050 <= profits[i] <= 1040 <= capital[i] <= 109
