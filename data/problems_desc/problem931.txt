You are given two integer sequences: a signal and a mask. Your task is to process the signal by moving the mask through the signal from left to right. At each mask position calculate the sum of products of aligned signal and mask values in the part where the signal and the mask overlap.InputThe first input line consists of two integersnnnandmmm: the length of the signal and the length of the mask.The next line consists ofnnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\ldots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​defining the signal.The last line consists ofmmmintegersb1,b2,…,bmb_1,b_2,\ldots,b_mb1​,b2​,…,bm​defining the mask.OutputPrintn+m−1n+m-1n+m−1integers: the sum of products of aligned values at each mask position from left to right.Constraints1≤n,m≤2⋅1051 \le n,m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,m≤2⋅1051≤ai,bi≤1001 \le a_i,b_i \le 1001≤ai​,bi​≤100ExampleInput:5 3
