You are given an array ofnnnintegers. Your task is to calculate for each window ofkkkelements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making all elements equal.You can increase or decrease each element with costxxxwherexxxis the difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum of such costs.InputThe first line contains two integersnnnandkkk: the number of elements and the size of the window.Then there arennnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the array.OutputOutputn−k+1n-k+1n−k+1values: the costs.Constraints1≤k≤n≤2⋅1051 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤k≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤109ExampleInput:8 3
