There is a list ofnnnnumbers and two players who move alternately. On each move, a player removes either the first or last number from the list, and their score increases by that number. Both players try to maximize their scores.What is the maximum possible score for the first player when both players play optimally?InputThe first input line contains an integernnn: the size of the list.The next line hasnnnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the list.OutputPrint the maximum possible score for the first player.Constraints1≤n≤50001 \le n \le 50001≤n≤5000−109≤xi≤109-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9−109≤xi​≤109ExampleInput:4
