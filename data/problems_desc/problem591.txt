Ann-bit gray code sequenceis a sequence of2nintegers where:Every integer is in theinclusiverange[0, 2n- 1],The first integer is0,An integer appearsno more than oncein the sequence,The binary representation of every pair ofadjacentintegers differs byexactly one bit, andThe binary representation of thefirstandlastintegers differs byexactly one bit.Given an integern, returnany validn-bit gray code sequence.Example 1:Input:n = 2Output:[0,1,3,2]Explanation:The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00and 01differ by one bit
-01 and11 differ by one bit
- 11and 10differ by one bit
-10 and00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
-00 and10 differ by one bit
- 10and 11differ by one bit
-11 and01 differ by one bit
- 01and 00differ by one bitExample 2:Input:n = 1Output:[0,1]Constraints:1 <= n <= 16
