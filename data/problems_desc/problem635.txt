You have an undirected, connected graph ofnnodes labeled from0ton - 1. You are given an arraygraphwheregraph[i]is a list of all the nodes connected with nodeiby an edge.Returnthe length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.Example 1:Input:graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]Output:4Explanation:One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]Example 2:Input:graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]Output:4Explanation:One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]Constraints:n == graph.length1 <= n <= 120 <= graph[i].length <Â ngraph[i]does not containi.Ifgraph[a]containsb, thengraph[b]containsa.The input graph is always connected.
