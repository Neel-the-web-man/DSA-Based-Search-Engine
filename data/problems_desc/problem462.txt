You are given an arraypointscontaining the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, wherepoints[i] = [xi, yi]such thatxi< xjfor all1 <= i < j <= points.length. You are also given an integerk.Returnthe maximum value of the equationyi+ yj+ |xi- xj|where|xi- xj| <= kand1 <= i < j <= points.length.It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint|xi- xj| <= k.Example 1:Input:points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1Output:4Explanation:The first two points satisfy the condition |xi- xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.Example 2:Input:points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3Output:3Explanation:Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.Constraints:2 <= points.length <= 105points[i].length == 2-108<= xi, yi<= 1080 <= k <= 2 * 108xi< xjfor all1 <= i < j <= points.lengthxiform a strictly increasing sequence.
