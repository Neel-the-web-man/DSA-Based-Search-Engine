An array issquarefulif the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is aperfect square.Given an integer array nums, returnthe number of permutations ofnumsthat aresquareful.Two permutationsperm1andperm2are different if there is some indexisuch thatperm1[i] != perm2[i].Example 1:Input:nums = [1,17,8]Output:2Explanation:[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.Example 2:Input:nums = [2,2,2]Output:1Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 120 <= nums[i] <= 109
