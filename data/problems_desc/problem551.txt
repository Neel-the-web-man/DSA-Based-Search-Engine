There arenworkers. You are given two integer arraysqualityandwagewherequality[i]is the quality of theithworker andwage[i]is the minimum wage expectation for theithworker.We want to hire exactlykworkers to form apaid group. To hire a group ofkworkers, we must pay them according to the following rules:Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.Given the integerk, returnthe least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within10-5of the actual answer will be accepted.Example 1:Input:quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2Output:105.00000Explanation:We pay 70 to 0thworker and 35 to 2ndworker.Example 2:Input:quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], k = 3Output:30.66667Explanation:We pay 4 to 0thworker, 13.33333 to 2ndand 3rdworkers separately.Constraints:n == quality.length == wage.length1 <= k <= n <= 1041 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 104
