Given an integer arraynumsand an integerk, modify the array in the following way:choose an indexiand replacenums[i]with-nums[i].You should apply this process exactlyktimes. You may choose the same indeximultiple times.Returnthe largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.Example 1:Input:nums = [4,2,3], k = 1Output:5Explanation:Choose index 1 and nums becomes [4,-2,3].Example 2:Input:nums = [3,-1,0,2], k = 3Output:6Explanation:Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and nums becomes [3,1,0,2].Example 3:Input:nums = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], k = 2Output:13Explanation:Choose indices (1, 4) and nums becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 104-100 <= nums[i] <= 1001 <= k <= 104
