A set is initially empty andnnnpoints are added to it. Calculate the maximum Manhattan distance of two points after each addition.InputThe first line has an integernnn: the number of points.The followingnnnlines describe the points. Each line has two integersxxxandyyy. You can assume that each point is distinct.OutputAfter each addition, print the maximum distance.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅105−109≤x,y≤109-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9−109≤x,y≤109ExampleInput:5
