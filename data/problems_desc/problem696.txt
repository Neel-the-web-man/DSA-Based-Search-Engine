Consider a two player game where each player hasnnncards numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n. On each turn both players place one of their cards on the table. The player who placed the higher card gets one point. If the cards are equal, neither player gets a point. The game continues until all cards have been played.You are given the number of cardsnnnand the players' scores at the end of the game,aaaandbbb. Your task is to give an example of how the game could have played out.InputThe first line contains one integerttt: the number of tests.Then there aretttlines, each with three integersnnn,aaaandbbb.OutputFor each test case printYESif there is a game with the given outcome andNOotherwise.If the answer isYES, print an example of one possible game. Print two lines representing the order in which the players place their cards. You can give any valid example.Constraints1≤t≤10001 \le t \le 10001≤t≤10001≤n≤1001 \le n \le 1001≤n≤1000≤a,b≤n0 \le a,b \le n0≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5
