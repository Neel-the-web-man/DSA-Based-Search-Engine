You are given an array of stringsequationsthat represent relationships between variables where each stringequations[i]is of length4and takes one of two different forms:"xi==yi"or"xi!=yi".Here,xiandyiare lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.Returntrueif it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, orfalseotherwise.Example 1:Input:equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]Output:falseExplanation:If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.Example 2:Input:equations = ["b==a","a==b"]Output:trueExplanation:We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.Constraints:1 <= equations.length <= 500equations[i].length == 4equations[i][0]is a lowercase letter.equations[i][1]is either'='or'!'.equations[i][2]is'='.equations[i][3]is a lowercase letter.
