Consider a game where two players remove sticks from a heap. The players move alternately, and the player who removes the last stick wins the game.A setP={p1,p2,…,pk}P=\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_k\}P={p1​,p2​,…,pk​}determines the allowed moves. For example, ifP={1,3,4}P=\{1,3,4\}P={1,3,4}, a player may remove111,333or444sticks.Your task is find out for each number of sticks1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,nif the first player has a winning or losing position.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandkkk: the number of sticks and moves.The next line haskkkintegersp1,p2,…,pkp_1,p_2,\dots,p_kp1​,p2​,…,pk​that describe the allowed moves. All integers are distinct, and one of them is111.OutputPrint a string containingnnncharacters:Wmeans a winning position, andLmeans a losing position.Constraints1≤n≤1061 \le n \le 10^61≤n≤1061≤k≤1001 \le k \le 1001≤k≤1001≤pi≤n1 \le p_i \le n1≤pi​≤nExampleInput:10 3
