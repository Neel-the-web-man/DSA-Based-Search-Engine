A directed graph consists ofnnnnodes andmmmedges. The edges are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Your task is to answerqqqqueries of the form "can you reach nodebbbfrom nodeaaa?"InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmmandqqq: the number of nodes, edges and queries.Then there aremmmlines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge from nodeaaato nodebbb.Finally there areqqqlines describing the queries. Each line consists of two integersaaaandbbb: "can you reach nodebbbfrom nodeaaa?"OutputPrint the answer for each query: either "YES" or "NO".Constraints1≤n≤5⋅1041 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^41≤n≤5⋅1041≤m,q≤1051 \le m,q \le 10^51≤m,q≤105ExampleInput:4 4 3
