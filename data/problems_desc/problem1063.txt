There is a2×n2 \times n2×ngrid whose each cell contains some number of coins. The total number of coins is2n2n2n.Your task is to arrange the coins so that each cell contains exactly one coin. On each move you can choose any coin and move it one step left, right, up or down.What is the minimum number of moves if you act optimally?InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the width of the grid.After this, there are two lines that describe the grid. Each line hasnnnintegers: the number of coins in each cell.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum number of moves.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤105ExampleInput:4
