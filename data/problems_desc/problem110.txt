Given an integer arraynums, find thesubarraywith the largest sum, and returnits sum.Example 1:Input:nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]Output:6Explanation:The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.Example 2:Input:nums = [1]Output:1Explanation:The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.Example 3:Input:nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]Output:23Explanation:The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 105-104<= nums[i] <= 104Follow up:If you have figured out theO(n)solution, try coding another solution using thedivide and conquerapproach, which is more subtle.
