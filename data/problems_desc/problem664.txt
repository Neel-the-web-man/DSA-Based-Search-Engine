There arenpeople and40types of hats labeled from1to40.Given a 2D integer arrayhats, wherehats[i]is a list of all hats preferred by theithperson.Return the number of ways thatnpeople can weardifferenthats from each other.Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo109+ 7.Example 1:Input:hats = [[3,4],[4,5],[5]]Output:1Explanation:There is only one way to choose hats given the conditions. 
First person choose hat 3, Second person choose hat 4 and last one hat 5.Example 2:Input:hats = [[3,5,1],[3,5]]Output:4Explanation:There are 4 ways to choose hats:
(3,5), (5,3), (1,3) and (1,5)Example 3:Input:hats = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]]Output:24Explanation:Each person can choose hats labeled from 1 to 4.
Number of Permutations of (1,2,3,4) = 24.Constraints:n == hats.length1 <= n <= 101 <= hats[i].length <= 401 <= hats[i][j] <= 40hats[i]contains a list ofuniqueintegers.
