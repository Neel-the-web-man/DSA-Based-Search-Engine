You are given an input list that consists ofnnnnumbers. Each integer between111andnnnappears exactly once in the list.Your task is to create a sorted output list using two stacks. On each move you can do one of the following:Move the first number from the input list to a stackMove a number from a stack to the end of the output listInputThe first input line has an integernnn.The second line hasnnnintegers: the contents of the input list.OutputPrintnnnintegers: for each number the stack where it is moved (111or222).You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, printIMPOSSIBLE.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅105ExampleInput:5
