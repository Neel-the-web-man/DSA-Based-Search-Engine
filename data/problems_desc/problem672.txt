You are given a strings. Anawesomesubstring is a non-empty substring ofssuch that we can make any number of swaps in order to make it a palindrome.Returnthe length of the maximum lengthawesome substringofs.Example 1:Input:s = "3242415"Output:5Explanation:"24241" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "24142" with some swaps.Example 2:Input:s = "12345678"Output:1Example 3:Input:s = "213123"Output:6Explanation:"213123" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "231132" with some swaps.Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 105sconsists only of digits.
