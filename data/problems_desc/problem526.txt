Given an integer arraynums, you need to find onecontinuous subarraysuch that if you only sort this subarray in non-decreasing order, then the whole array will be sorted in non-decreasing order.Returnthe shortest such subarray and output its length.Example 1:Input:nums = [2,6,4,8,10,9,15]Output:5Explanation:You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array sorted in ascending order.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4]Output:0Example 3:Input:nums = [1]Output:0Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 104-105<= nums[i] <= 105Follow up:Can you solve it inO(n)time complexity?
