Given an undirected weighted graph and edge sets, determine for each set if the edges can be included in a minimum spanning tree.InputThe first line has three integersnnn,mmmandqqq: the number of nodes, edges and edge sets. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.The followingmmmlines describe the edges. Each line has three integersaaa,bbb,www: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbbwith weightwww. The edges are numbered1,2,…,m1,2,\dots,m1,2,…,min the input order.The following2q2q2qlines describe the edge sets. For each set, the first line contains its size and the second line contains its edges. The total number of edges in all sets is at mostmmm.You can assume that the graph is connected and simple and each edge appears at most once in the graph.OutputFor each edge set, printYESif the edges can be included in the minimum spanning tree andNOotherwise.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m,q≤2⋅1051 \le m, q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m,q≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤w≤1091 \le w \le 10^91≤w≤109ExampleInput:5 6 4
