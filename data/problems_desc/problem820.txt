Your task is to maintain a list of arrays which initially has a single array. You have to process the following types of queries:Set the valueaaain arraykkktoxxx.Calculate the sum of values in range[a,b][a,b][a,b]in arraykkk.Create a copy of arraykkkand add it to the end of the list.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandqqq: the array size and the number of queries.The next line hasnnnintegerst1,t2,…,tnt_1,t_2,\ldots,t_nt1​,t2​,…,tn​: the initial contents of the array.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: "1kkkaaaxxx", "2kkkaaabbb" or "3kkk".OutputPrint the answer to each sum query.Constraints1≤n,q≤2⋅1051 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,q≤2⋅1051≤ti,x≤1091 \le t_i, x \le 10^91≤ti​,x≤1091≤a≤b≤n1 \le a \le b \le n1≤a≤b≤nExampleInput:5 6
