You are given an integer arraycoinsrepresenting coins of different denominations and an integeramountrepresenting a total amount of money.Returnthe number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return0.You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.The answer isguaranteedto fit into a signed32-bitinteger.Example 1:Input:amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]Output:4Explanation:there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1Example 2:Input:amount = 3, coins = [2]Output:0Explanation:the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.Example 3:Input:amount = 10, coins = [10]Output:1Constraints:1 <= coins.length <= 3001 <= coins[i] <= 5000All the values ofcoinsareunique.0 <= amount <= 5000
