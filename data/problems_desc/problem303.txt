You are given an arraypointsrepresenting integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, wherepoints[i] = [xi, yi].The cost of connecting two points[xi, yi]and[xj, yj]is themanhattan distancebetween them:|xi- xj| + |yi- yj|, where|val|denotes the absolute value ofval.Returnthe minimum cost to make all points connected.All points are connected if there isexactly onesimple path between any two points.Example 1:Input:points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]Output:20Explanation:We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.Example 2:Input:points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]Output:18Constraints:1 <= points.length <= 1000-106<= xi, yi<= 106All pairs(xi, yi)are distinct.
