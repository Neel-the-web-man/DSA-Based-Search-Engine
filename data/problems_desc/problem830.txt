You are given a tree consisting ofnnnnodes, andmmmpaths in the tree.Your task is to calculate for each node the number of paths containing that node.InputThe first input line contains integersnnnandmmm: the number of nodes and paths. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n.Then there aren−1n-1n−1lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb.Finally, there aremmmlines describing the paths. Each line contains two integersaaaandbbb: there is a path between nodesaaaandbbb.OutputPrintnnnintegers: for each node1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n, the number of paths containing that node.Constraints1≤n,m≤2⋅1051 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5 3
