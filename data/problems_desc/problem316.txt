There is a country ofncities numbered from0ton - 1whereall the cities are connectedby bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer arrayedgeswhereedges[i] = [xi, yi, timei]denotes a road between citiesxiandyithat takestimeiminutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a0-indexedinteger arraypassingFeesof lengthnwherepassingFees[j]is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through cityj.In the beginning, you are at city0and want to reach cityn - 1inmaxTimeminutes or less. Thecostof your journey is thesummation of passing feesfor each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (includingthe source and destination cities).GivenmaxTime,edges, andpassingFees, returntheminimum costto complete your journey, or-1if you cannot complete it withinmaxTimeminutes.Example 1:Input:maxTime = 30, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]Output:11Explanation:The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.Example 2:Input:maxTime = 29, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]Output:48Explanation:The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.Example 3:Input:maxTime = 25, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]Output:-1Explanation:There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.Constraints:1 <= maxTime <= 1000n == passingFees.length2 <= n <= 1000n - 1 <= edges.length <= 10000 <= xi, yi<= n - 11 <= timei<= 10001 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.The graph does not contain self loops.
