You are given an array of CPUtasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a numbern. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap ofat leastnintervals between two tasks with the same label.Return theminimumnumber of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.Example 1:Input:tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2Output:8Explanation:A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rdinterval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4thinterval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.Example 2:Input:tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1Output:6Explanation:A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.Example 3:Input:tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3Output:10Explanation:A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.Constraints:1 <= tasks.length <= 104tasks[i]is an uppercase English letter.0 <= n <= 100
