There arenservers numbered from0ton - 1connected by undirected server-to-serverconnectionsforming a network whereconnections[i] = [ai, bi]represents a connection between serversaiandbi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.Acritical connectionis a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.Return all critical connections in the network in any order.Example 1:Input:n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]Output:[[1,3]]Explanation:[[3,1]] is also accepted.Example 2:Input:n = 2, connections = [[0,1]]Output:[[0,1]]Constraints:2 <= n <= 105n - 1 <= connections.length <= 1050 <= ai, bi<= n - 1ai!= biThere are no repeated connections.
