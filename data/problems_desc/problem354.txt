Given an integer arraynumsand two integerslowerandupper, returnthe number of range sums that lie in[lower, upper]inclusive.Range sumS(i, j)is defined as the sum of the elements innumsbetween indicesiandjinclusive, wherei <= j.Example 1:Input:nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2Output:3Explanation:The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.Example 2:Input:nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0Output:1Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 105-231<= nums[i] <= 231- 1-105<= lower <= upper <= 105The answer isguaranteedto fit in a32-bitinteger.
