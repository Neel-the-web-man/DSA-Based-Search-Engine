Given an array of integersnumsand an integerlimit, return the size of the longestnon-emptysubarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal tolimit.Example 1:Input:nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4Output:2Explanation:All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.Example 2:Input:nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5Output:4Explanation:The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.Example 3:Input:nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0Output:3Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 1090 <= limit <= 109
