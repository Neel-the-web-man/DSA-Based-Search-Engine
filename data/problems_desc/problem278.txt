We want to split a group ofnpeople (labeled from1ton) into two groups ofany size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.Given the integernand the arraydislikeswheredislikes[i] = [ai, bi]indicates that the person labeledaidoes not like the person labeledbi, returntrueif it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.Example 1:Input:n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]Output:trueExplanation:The first group has [1,4], and the second group has [2,3].Example 2:Input:n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]Output:falseExplanation:We need at least 3 groups to divide them. We cannot put them in two groups.Constraints:1 <= n <= 20000 <= dislikes.length <= 104dislikes[i].length == 21 <= ai< bi<= nAll the pairs ofdislikesareunique.
