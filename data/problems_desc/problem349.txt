Given an array of integerscitationswherecitations[i]is the number of citations a researcher received for theirithpaper andcitationsis sorted innon-descending order, returnthe researcher's h-index.According to thedefinition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value ofhsuch that the given researcher has published at leasthpapers that have each been cited at leasthtimes.You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.Example 1:Input:citations = [0,1,3,5,6]Output:3Explanation:[0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.Example 2:Input:citations = [1,2,100]Output:2Constraints:n == citations.length1 <= n <= 1050 <= citations[i] <= 1000citationsis sorted inascending order.
