Consider the following string transformation:append the character # to the string (we assume that # is lexicographically smaller than all other characters of the string)generate all rotations of the stringsort the rotations in increasing orderbased on this order, construct a new string that contains the last character of each rotationFor example, the stringbabcbecomesbabc#. Then, the sorted list of rotations is#babc,abc#b,babc#,bc#ba, andc#bab. This yields a stringcb#ab.InputThe only input line contains the transformed string of lengthn+1n+1n+1. Each character of the original string is one of a–z.OutputPrint the original string of lengthnnn.Constraints1≤n≤1061 \le n \le 10^61≤n≤106ExampleInput:cb#abOutput:babc
