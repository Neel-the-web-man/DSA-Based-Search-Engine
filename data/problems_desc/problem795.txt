There arennnboys andmmmgirls in a school. Next week a school dance will be organized. A dance pair consists of a boy and a girl, and there arekkkpotential pairs.Your task is to find out the maximum number of dance pairs and show how this number can be achieved.InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmmandkkk: the number of boys, girls, and potential pairs. The boys are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n, and the girls are numbered1,2,…,m1,2,\dots,m1,2,…,m.After this, there arekkklines describing the potential pairs. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: boyaaaand girlbbbare willing to dance together.OutputFirst print one integerrrr: the maximum number of dance pairs. After this, printrrrlines describing the pairs. You can print any valid solution.Constraints1≤n,m≤5001 \le n,m \le 5001≤n,m≤5001≤k≤10001 \le k \le 10001≤k≤10001≤a≤n1 \le a \le n1≤a≤n1≤b≤m1 \le b \le m1≤b≤mExampleInput:3 2 4
