Given an array ofdistinctintegersnumsand a target integertarget, returnthe number of possible combinations that add up totarget.The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a32-bitinteger.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,3], target = 4Output:7Explanation:The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.Example 2:Input:nums = [9], target = 3Output:0Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 2001 <= nums[i] <= 1000All the elements ofnumsareunique.1 <= target <= 1000Follow up:What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
