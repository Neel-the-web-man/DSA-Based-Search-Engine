You havenjobs andmworkers. You are given three arrays:difficulty,profit, andworkerwhere:difficulty[i]andprofit[i]are the difficulty and the profit of theithjob, andworker[j]is the ability ofjthworker (i.e., thejthworker can only complete a job with difficulty at mostworker[j]).Every worker can be assignedat most one job, but one job can becompleted multiple times.For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays$1, then the total profit will be$3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is$0.Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.Example 1:Input:difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]Output:100Explanation:Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.Example 2:Input:difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]Output:0Constraints:n == difficulty.lengthn == profit.lengthm == worker.length1 <= n, m <= 1041 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105
