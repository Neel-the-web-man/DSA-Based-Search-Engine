You have information aboutndifferent recipes. You are given a string arrayrecipesand a 2D string arrayingredients. Theithrecipe has the namerecipes[i], and you cancreateit if you haveallthe needed ingredients fromingredients[i]. A recipe can also be an ingredient forotherrecipes, i.e.,ingredients[i]may contain a string that is inrecipes.You are also given a string arraysuppliescontaining all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.Returna list of all the recipes that you can create.You may return the answer inany order.Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.Example 1:Input:recipes = ["bread"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","corn"]Output:["bread"]Explanation:We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".Example 2:Input:recipes = ["bread","sandwich"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]Output:["bread","sandwich"]Explanation:We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredient "bread".Example 3:Input:recipes = ["bread","sandwich","burger"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"],["sandwich","meat","bread"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]Output:["bread","sandwich","burger"]Explanation:We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredient "bread".
We can create "burger" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredients "bread" and "sandwich".Constraints:n == recipes.length == ingredients.length1 <= n <= 1001 <= ingredients[i].length, supplies.length <= 1001 <= recipes[i].length, ingredients[i][j].length, supplies[k].length <= 10recipes[i], ingredients[i][j], andsupplies[k]consist only of lowercase English letters.All the values ofrecipesandsuppliescombined are unique.Eachingredients[i]does not contain any duplicate values.
