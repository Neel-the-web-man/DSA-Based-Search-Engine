You are given a list of bombs. Therangeof a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of acirclewith the center as the location of the bomb.The bombs are represented by a0-indexed2D integer arraybombswherebombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri].xiandyidenote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of theithbomb, whereasridenotes theradiusof its range.You may choose to detonate asinglebomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonateall bombsthat lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.Given the list ofbombs, returnthemaximumnumber of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonateonly onebomb.Example 1:Input:bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]Output:2Explanation:The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.Example 2:Input:bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]Output:1Explanation:Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.Example 3:Input:bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]Output:5Explanation:The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
- Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.
- Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.
- Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.
Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.Constraints:1 <= bombs.lengthÂ <= 100bombs[i].length == 31 <= xi, yi, ri<= 105
