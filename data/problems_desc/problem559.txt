You are given two stringsstampandtarget. Initially, there is a stringsof lengthtarget.lengthwith alls[i] == '?'.In one turn, you can placestampoversand replace every letter in theswith the corresponding letter fromstamp.For example, ifstamp = "abc"andtarget = "abcba", thensis"?????"initially. In one turn you can:placestampat index0ofsto obtain"abc??",placestampat index1ofsto obtain"?abc?", orplacestampat index2ofsto obtain"??abc".Note thatstampmust be fully contained in the boundaries ofsin order to stamp (i.e., you cannot placestampat index3ofs).We want to convertstotargetusingat most10 * target.lengthturns.Returnan array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn. If we cannot obtaintargetfromswithin10 * target.lengthturns, return an empty array.Example 1:Input:stamp = "abc", target = "ababc"Output:[0,2]Explanation:Initially s = "?????".
- Place stamp at index 0 to get "abc??".
- Place stamp at index 2 to get "ababc".
[1,0,2] would also be accepted as an answer, as well as some other answers.Example 2:Input:stamp = "abca", target = "aabcaca"Output:[3,0,1]Explanation:Initially s = "???????".
- Place stamp at index 3 to get "???abca".
- Place stamp at index 0 to get "abcabca".
- Place stamp at index 1 to get "aabcaca".Constraints:1 <= stamp.length <= target.length <= 1000stampandtargetconsist of lowercase English letters.
