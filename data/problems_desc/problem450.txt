You are given two stringssandtof the same length and an integermaxCost.You want to changestot. Changing theithcharacter ofstoithcharacter oftcosts|s[i] - t[i]|(i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).Returnthe maximum length of a substring ofsthat can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring oftwith a cost less than or equal tomaxCost. If there is no substring fromsthat can be changed to its corresponding substring fromt, return0.Example 1:Input:s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3Output:3Explanation:"abc" of s can change to "bcd".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.Example 2:Input:s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3Output:1Explanation:Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.Example 3:Input:s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0Output:1Explanation:You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 105t.length == s.length0 <= maxCost <= 106sandtconsist of only lowercase English letters.
