There is adirected graphofncolored nodes andmedges. The nodes are numbered from0ton - 1.You are given a stringcolorswherecolors[i]is a lowercase English letter representing thecolorof theithnode in this graph (0-indexed). You are also given a 2D arrayedgeswhereedges[j] = [aj, bj]indicates that there is adirected edgefrom nodeajto nodebj.A validpathin the graph is a sequence of nodesx1-> x2-> x3-> ... -> xksuch that there is a directed edge fromxitoxi+1for every1 <= i < k. Thecolor valueof the path is the number of nodes that are colored themost frequentlyoccurring color along that path.Returnthelargest color valueof any valid path in the given graph, or-1if the graph contains a cycle.Example 1:Input:colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]Output:3Explanation:The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored"a" (red in the above image).Example 2:Input:colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]Output:-1Explanation:There is a cycle from 0 to 0.Constraints:n == colors.lengthm == edges.length1 <= n <= 1050 <= m <= 105colorsconsists of lowercase English letters.0 <= aj, bj< n
