You are given an arraypeoplewherepeople[i]is the weight of theithperson, and aninfinite number of boatswhere each boat can carry a maximum weight oflimit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at mostlimit.Returnthe minimum number of boats to carry every given person.Example 1:Input:people = [1,2], limit = 3Output:1Explanation:1 boat (1, 2)Example 2:Input:people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3Output:3Explanation:3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)Example 3:Input:people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5Output:4Explanation:4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)Constraints:1 <= people.length <= 5 * 1041 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104
