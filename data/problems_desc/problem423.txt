Given a stringsand an integerk, returnthe length of the longest substring ofssuch that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal tok.if no such substring exists, return 0.Example 1:Input:s = "aaabb", k = 3Output:3Explanation:The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.Example 2:Input:s = "ababbc", k = 2Output:5Explanation:The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 104sconsists of only lowercase English letters.1 <= k <= 105
