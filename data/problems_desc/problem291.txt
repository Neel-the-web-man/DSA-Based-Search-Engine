There arencomputers numbered from0ton - 1connected by ethernet cablesconnectionsforming a network whereconnections[i] = [ai, bi]represents a connection between computersaiandbi. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.You are given an initial computer networkconnections. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.Returnthe minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it is not possible, return-1.Example 1:Input:n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]Output:1Explanation:Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.Example 2:Input:n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]Output:2Example 3:Input:n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]Output:-1Explanation:There are not enough cables.Constraints:1 <= n <= 1051 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 105)connections[i].length == 20 <= ai, bi< nai!= biThere are no repeated connections.No two computers are connected by more than one cable.
