You are given an integer arrayheightof lengthn. There arenvertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of theithline are(i, 0)and(i, height[i]).Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.Returnthe maximum amount of water a container can store.Noticethat you may not slant the container.Example 1:Input:height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]Output:49Explanation:The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.Example 2:Input:height = [1,1]Output:1Constraints:n == height.length2 <= n <= 1050 <= height[i] <= 104
