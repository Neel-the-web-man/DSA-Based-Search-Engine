Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:Here, we havediras the only directory in the root.dircontains two subdirectories,subdir1andsubdir2.subdir1contains a filefile1.extand subdirectorysubsubdir1.subdir2contains a subdirectorysubsubdir2, which contains a filefile2.ext.In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.extIf we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this:"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext". Note that the'\n'and'\t'are the new-line and tab characters.Every file and directory has a uniqueabsolute pathin the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by'/'s. Using the above example, theabsolute pathtofile2.extis"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the formname.extension, wherenameandextensionconsist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.Given a stringinputrepresenting the file system in the explained format, returnthe length of thelongest absolute pathto afilein the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return0.Notethat the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.Example 1:Input:input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"Output:20Explanation:We have only one file, and the absolute path is "dir/subdir2/file.ext" of length 20.Example 2:Input:input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"Output:32Explanation:We have two files:
"dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21
"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.Example 3:Input:input = "a"Output:0Explanation:We do not have any files, just a single directory named "a".Constraints:1 <= input.length <= 104inputmay contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character'\n', a tab character'\t', a dot'.', a space' ', and digits.All file and directory names havepositivelength.
