You are givenmarrays, where each array is sorted inascending order.You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two integersaandbto be their absolute difference|a - b|.Returnthe maximum distance.Example 1:Input:arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3]]Output:4Explanation:One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.Example 2:Input:arrays = [[1],[1]]Output:0Constraints:m == arrays.length2 <= m <= 1051 <= arrays[i].length <= 500-104<= arrays[i][j] <= 104arrays[i]is sorted inascending order.There will be at most105integers in all the arrays.
