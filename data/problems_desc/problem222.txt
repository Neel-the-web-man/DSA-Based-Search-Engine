Given two stringssandt,determine if they are isomorphic.Two stringssandtare isomorphic if the characters inscan be replaced to gett.All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.Example 1:Input:s = "egg", t = "add"Output:trueExplanation:The stringssandtcan be made identical by:Mapping'e'to'a'.Mapping'g'to'd'.Example 2:Input:s = "foo", t = "bar"Output:falseExplanation:The stringssandtcan not be made identical as'o'needs to be mapped to both'a'and'r'.Example 3:Input:s = "paper", t = "title"Output:trueConstraints:1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104t.length == s.lengthsandtconsist of any valid ascii character.
