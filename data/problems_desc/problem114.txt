You are given an array of non-overlapping intervalsintervalswhereintervals[i] = [starti, endi]represent the start and the end of theithinterval andintervalsis sorted in ascending order bystarti. You are also given an intervalnewInterval = [start, end]that represents the start and end of another interval.InsertnewIntervalintointervalssuch thatintervalsis still sorted in ascending order bystartiandintervalsstill does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).Returnintervalsafter the insertion.Notethat you don't need to modifyintervalsin-place. You can make a new array and return it.Example 1:Input:intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]Output:[[1,5],[6,9]]Example 2:Input:intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]Output:[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]Explanation:Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].Constraints:0 <= intervals.length <= 104intervals[i].length == 20 <= starti<= endi<= 105intervalsis sorted bystartiinascendingorder.newInterval.length == 20 <= start <= end <= 105
