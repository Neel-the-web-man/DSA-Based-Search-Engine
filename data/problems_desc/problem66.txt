Given an integer arraynums, returnthe number of all thearithmetic subsequencesofnums.A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists ofat least three elementsand if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.For example,[1, 3, 5, 7, 9],[7, 7, 7, 7], and[3, -1, -5, -9]are arithmetic sequences.For example,[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]is not an arithmetic sequence.Asubsequenceof an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.For example,[2,5,10]is a subsequence of[1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in32-bitinteger.Example 1:Input:nums = [2,4,6,8,10]Output:7Explanation:All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]Example 2:Input:nums = [7,7,7,7,7]Output:16Explanation:Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.Constraints:1Â  <= nums.length <= 1000-231<= nums[i] <= 231- 1
