Anadditive numberis a string whose digits can form anadditive sequence.A validadditive sequenceshould containat leastthree numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.Given a string containing only digits, returntrueif it is anadditive numberorfalseotherwise.Note:Numbers in the additive sequencecannothave leading zeros, so sequence1, 2, 03or1, 02, 3is invalid.Example 1:Input:"112358"Output:trueExplanation:The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8Example 2:Input:"199100199"Output:trueExplanation:The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.Â 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199Constraints:1 <= num.length <= 35numconsists only of digits.Follow up:How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?
