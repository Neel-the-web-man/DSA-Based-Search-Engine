There arennnbuildings on a street, numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n. Each building has a pizzeria and an apartment.The pizza price in buildingkkkispkp_kpk​. If you order a pizza from buildingaaato buildingbbb, its price (with delivery) ispa+∣a−b∣p_a+|a-b|pa​+∣a−b∣.Your task is to process two types of queries:The pizza pricepkp_kpk​in buildingkkkbecomesxxx.You are in buildingkkkand want to order a pizza. What is the minimum price?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandqqq: the number of buildings and queries.The second line hasnnnintegersp1,p2,…,pnp_1,p_2,\dots,p_np1​,p2​,…,pn​: the initial pizza price in each building.Finally, there areqqqlines that describe the queries. Each line is either "1kkkxxx" or "2kkk".OutputPrint the answer for each query of type 2.Constraints1≤n,q≤2⋅1051 \le n,q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,q≤2⋅1051≤pi,x≤1091 \le p_i, x \le 10^91≤pi​,x≤1091≤k≤n1 \le k \le n1≤k≤nExampleInput:6 3
