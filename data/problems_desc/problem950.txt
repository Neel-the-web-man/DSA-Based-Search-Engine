There werennncoders from Finland andnnncoders from Sweden in a programming contest. It turned out that after the contest, each coder had a distinct score.Your task is to find thekkk-th highest score in the contest.To do this, you can ask questions: you can choose a country (Finland or Sweden) and an integeriiiand you will be told theiii-th highest score for the chosen country.InteractionThis is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should start by reading two integersnnnandkkk.On your turn, you can print one of the following:"Fi\mathrm{F}\ iFi", where1≤i≤n1 \le i \le n1≤i≤n: ask theiii-th highest score for Finland."Si\mathrm{S}\ iSi", where1≤i≤n1 \le i \le n1≤i≤n: ask theiii-th highest score for Sweden."!s!\ s!s": report that thekkk-th highest score issss. Your program must terminate after this.Each line should be followed by a line break. You must make sure the output gets flushed after printing each line.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤k≤2n1 \le k \le 2n1≤k≤2neach score is between111and10910^9109you can ask at most100100100queries of the first two types in totalExample3 1
