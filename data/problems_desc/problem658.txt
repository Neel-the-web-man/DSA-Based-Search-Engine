Given an integernum, returnthe number of steps to reduce it to zero.In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by2, otherwise, you have to subtract1from it.Example 1:Input:num = 14Output:6Explanation:Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.Example 2:Input:num = 8Output:4Explanation:Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.Example 3:Input:num = 123Output:12Constraints:0 <= num <= 106
