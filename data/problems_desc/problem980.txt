Given an undirected graph, your task is to determine itsgirth, i.e., the length of its shortest cycle.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aremmmlines describing the edges. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb.You may assume that there is at most one edge between each two nodes.OutputPrint one integer: the girth of the graph. If there are no cycles, print−1-1−1.Constraints1≤n≤25001 \le n \le 25001≤n≤25001≤m≤50001 \le m \le 50001≤m≤5000ExampleInput:5 6
