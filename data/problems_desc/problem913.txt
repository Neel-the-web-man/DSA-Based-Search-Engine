The Hamming distance between two stringsaaaandbbbof equal length is the number of positions where the strings differ.You are givennnnbit strings, each of lengthkkkand your task is to calculate the minimum Hamming distance between two strings.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandkkk: the number of bit strings and their length.Then there arennnlines each consisting of one bit string of lengthkkk.OutputPrint the minimum Hamming distance between two strings.Constraints2≤n≤2⋅1042 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^42≤n≤2⋅1041≤k≤301 \le k \le 301≤k≤30ExampleInput:5 6
