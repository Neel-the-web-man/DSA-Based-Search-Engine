There are a total ofnumCoursescourses you have to take, labeled from0tonumCourses - 1. You are given an arrayprerequisiteswhereprerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]indicates that youmusttake courseaifirst if you want to take coursebi.For example, the pair[0, 1]indicates that you have to take course0before you can take course1.Prerequisites can also beindirect. If courseais a prerequisite of courseb, and coursebis a prerequisite of coursec, then courseais a prerequisite of coursec.You are also given an arrayquerieswherequeries[j] = [uj, vj]. For thejthquery, you should answer whether courseujis a prerequisite of coursevjor not.Returna boolean arrayanswer, whereanswer[j]is the answer to thejthquery.Example 1:Input:numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]Output:[false,true]Explanation:The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.
Course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.Example 2:Input:numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]Output:[false,false]Explanation:There are no prerequisites, and each course is independent.Example 3:Input:numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]Output:[true,true]Constraints:2 <= numCourses <= 1000 <= prerequisites.length <= (numCourses * (numCourses - 1) / 2)prerequisites[i].length == 20 <= ai, bi<= numCourses - 1ai!= biAll the pairs[ai, bi]areunique.The prerequisites graph has no cycles.1 <= queries.length <= 1040 <= ui, vi<= numCourses - 1ui!= vi
