There is anundirectedgraph withnnodes, numbered from0ton - 1.You are given a0-indexedinteger arrayscoresof lengthnwherescores[i]denotes the score of nodei. You are also given a 2D integer arrayedgeswhereedges[i] = [ai, bi]denotes that there exists anundirectededge connecting nodesaiandbi.A node sequence isvalidif it meets the following conditions:There is an edge connecting every pair ofadjacentnodes in the sequence.No node appears more than once in the sequence.The score of a node sequence is defined as thesumof the scores of the nodes in the sequence.Returnthemaximum scoreof a valid node sequence with a length of4.If no such sequence exists, return-1.Example 1:Input:scores = [5,2,9,8,4], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]Output:24Explanation:The figure above shows the graph and the chosen node sequence [0,1,2,3].
The score of the node sequence is 5 + 2 + 9 + 8 = 24.
It can be shown that no other node sequence has a score of more than 24.
Note that the sequences [3,1,2,0] and [1,0,2,3] are also valid and have a score of 24.
The sequence [0,3,2,4] is not valid since no edge connects nodes 0 and 3.Example 2:Input:scores = [9,20,6,4,11,12], edges = [[0,3],[5,3],[2,4],[1,3]]Output:-1Explanation:The figure above shows the graph.
There are no valid node sequences of length 4, so we return -1.Constraints:n == scores.length4 <= n <= 5 * 1041 <= scores[i] <= 1080 <= edges.length <= 5 * 104edges[i].length == 20 <= ai, bi<= n - 1ai!= biThere are no duplicate edges.
