Given an input stringsand a patternp, implement regular expression matching with support for'.'and'*'where:'.'Matches any single character.​​​​'*'Matches zero or more of the preceding element.The matching should cover theentireinput string (not partial).Example 1:Input:s = "aa", p = "a"Output:falseExplanation:"a" does not match the entire string "aa".Example 2:Input:s = "aa", p = "a*"Output:trueExplanation:'*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".Example 3:Input:s = "ab", p = ".*"Output:trueExplanation:".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 201 <= p.length <= 20scontains only lowercase English letters.pcontains only lowercase English letters,'.', and'*'.It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character'*', there will be a previous valid character to match.
