You are given a0-indexedbinary stringsand two integersminJumpandmaxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index0, which is equal to'0'. You can move from indexito indexjif the following conditions are fulfilled:i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), ands[j] == '0'.Returntrueif you can reach indexs.length - 1ins, orfalseotherwise.Example 1:Input:s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3Output:trueExplanation:In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3. 
In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.Example 2:Input:s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3Output:falseConstraints:2 <= s.length <= 105s[i]is either'0'or'1'.s[0] == '0'1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length
