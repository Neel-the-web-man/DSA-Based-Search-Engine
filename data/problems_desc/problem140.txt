You are given anm x nmatrixboardcontainingletters'X'and'O',capture regionsthat aresurrounded:Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.Region: To form a regionconnect every'O'cell.Surround: The region is surrounded with'X'cells if you canconnect the regionwith'X'cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of theboard.To capture asurrounded region, replace all'O's with'X'sin-placewithin the original board. You do not need to return anything.Example 1:Input:board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]Output:[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]Explanation:In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.Example 2:Input:board = [["X"]]Output:[["X"]]Constraints:m == board.lengthn == board[i].length1 <= m, n <= 200board[i][j]is'X'or'O'.
