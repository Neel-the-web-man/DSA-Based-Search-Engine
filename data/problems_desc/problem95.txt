Apermutationof an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.For example, forarr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations ofarr:[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].Thenext permutationof an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then thenext permutationof that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).For example, the next permutation ofarr = [1,2,3]is[1,3,2].Similarly, the next permutation ofarr = [2,3,1]is[3,1,2].While the next permutation ofarr = [3,2,1]is[1,2,3]because[3,2,1]does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.Given an array of integersnums,find the next permutation ofnums.The replacement must bein placeand use only constant extra memory.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,3]Output:[1,3,2]Example 2:Input:nums = [3,2,1]Output:[1,2,3]Example 3:Input:nums = [1,1,5]Output:[1,5,1]Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1000 <= nums[i] <= 100
