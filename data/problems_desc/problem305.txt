There is an infrastructure ofncities with some number ofroadsconnecting these cities. Eachroads[i] = [ai, bi]indicates that there is a bidirectional road between citiesaiandbi.Thenetwork rankoftwo different citiesis defined as the total number ofdirectlyconnected roads toeithercity. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only countedonce.Themaximal network rankof the infrastructure is themaximum network rankof all pairs of different cities.Given the integernand the arrayroads, returnthemaximal network rankof the entire infrastructure.Example 1:Input:n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]Output:4Explanation:The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.Example 2:Input:n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]Output:5Explanation:There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.Example 3:Input:n = 8, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[5,6],[5,7]]Output:5Explanation:The network rank of 2 and 5 is 5. Notice that all the cities do not have to be connected.Constraints:2 <= n <= 1000 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2roads[i].length == 20 <= ai, bi<= n-1ai!= biEach pair of cities hasat most oneroad connecting them.
