An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists ofat least three elementsand if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.For example,[1,3,5,7,9],[7,7,7,7], and[3,-1,-5,-9]are arithmetic sequences.Given an integer arraynums, returnthe number of arithmeticsubarraysofnums.Asubarrayis a contiguous subsequence of the array.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4]Output:3Explanation:We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.Example 2:Input:nums = [1]Output:0Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 5000-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
