Given an array of integersheightsrepresenting the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is1, returnthe area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.Example 1:Input:heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]Output:10Explanation:The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.Example 2:Input:heights = [2,4]Output:4Constraints:1 <= heights.length <= 1050 <= heights[i] <= 104
