Given an undirected weighted graph, determine for each edge the minimum spanning tree cost if the edge must be included in the spanning tree.InputThe first line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.The followingmmmlines describe the edges. Each line has three integersaaa,bbb,www: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbbwith weightwww.You can assume that the graph is connected and simple and each edge appears at most once in the graph.OutputFor each edge in the input order, print the minimum spanning tree cost when the edge is included.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤w≤1091 \le w \le 10^91≤w≤109ExampleInput:5 6
