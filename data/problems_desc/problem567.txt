Given two integersaandb, returnanystringssuch that:shas lengtha + band contains exactlya'a'letters, and exactlyb'b'letters,The substring'aaa'does not occur ins, andThe substring'bbb'does not occur ins.Example 1:Input:a = 1, b = 2Output:"abb"Explanation:"abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.Example 2:Input:a = 4, b = 1Output:"aabaa"Constraints:0 <= a, b <= 100It is guaranteed such ansexists for the givenaandb.
