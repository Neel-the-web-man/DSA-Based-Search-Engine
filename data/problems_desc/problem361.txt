We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:I pick a number from1ton. You have to guess which number I picked.Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.You call a pre-defined APIint guess(int num), which returns three possible results:-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e.num > pick).1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e.num < pick).0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e.num == pick).Returnthe number that I picked.Example 1:Input:n = 10, pick = 6Output:6Example 2:Input:n = 1, pick = 1Output:1Example 3:Input:n = 2, pick = 1Output:1Constraints:1 <= n <= 231- 11 <= pick <= n
