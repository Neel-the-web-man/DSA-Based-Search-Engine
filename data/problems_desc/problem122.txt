Given an arraynumswithnobjects colored red, white, or blue, sort themin-placeso that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.We will use the integers0,1, and2to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.Example 1:Input:nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]Output:[0,0,1,1,2,2]Example 2:Input:nums = [2,0,1]Output:[0,1,2]Constraints:n == nums.length1 <= n <= 300nums[i]is either0,1, or2.Follow up:Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using onlyÂ constant extra space?
