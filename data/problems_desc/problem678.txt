You are given an array ofnintegers,nums, where there are at most50unique values in the array. You are also given an array ofmcustomer order quantities,quantity, wherequantity[i]is the amount of integers theithcustomer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distributenumssuch that:Theithcustomer getsexactlyquantity[i]integers,The integers theithcustomer gets areall equal, andEvery customer is satisfied.Returntrueif it is possible to distributenumsaccording to the above conditions.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4], quantity = [2]Output:falseExplanation:The 0thcustomer cannot be given two different integers.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,2,3,3], quantity = [2]Output:trueExplanation:The 0thcustomer is given [3,3]. The integers [1,2] are not used.Example 3:Input:nums = [1,1,2,2], quantity = [2,2]Output:trueExplanation:The 0thcustomer is given [1,1], and the 1st customer is given [2,2].Constraints:n == nums.length1 <= n <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 1000m == quantity.length1 <= m <= 101 <= quantity[i] <= 105There are at most50unique values innums.
