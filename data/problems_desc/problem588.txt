Given two integersdividendanddivisor, divide two integerswithoutusing multiplication, division, and mod operator.The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example,8.345would be truncated to8, and-2.7335would be truncated to-2.Returnthequotientafter dividingdividendbydivisor.Note:Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the32-bitsigned integer range:[−231, 231− 1]. For this problem, if the quotient isstrictly greater than231- 1, then return231- 1, and if the quotient isstrictly less than-231, then return-231.Example 1:Input:dividend = 10, divisor = 3Output:3Explanation:10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.Example 2:Input:dividend = 7, divisor = -3Output:-2Explanation:7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.Constraints:-231<= dividend, divisor <= 231- 1divisor != 0
