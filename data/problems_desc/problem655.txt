Given am x nbinary matrixmat. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbors of it if they exist (Flip is changing1to0and0to1). A pair of cells are called neighbors if they share one edge.Return theminimum number of stepsrequired to convertmatto a zero matrix or-1if you cannot.Abinary matrixis a matrix with all cells equal to0or1only.Azero matrixis a matrix with all cells equal to0.Example 1:Input:mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]Output:3Explanation:One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown.Example 2:Input:mat = [[0]]Output:0Explanation:Given matrix is a zero matrix. We do not need to change it.Example 3:Input:mat = [[1,0,0],[1,0,0]]Output:-1Explanation:Given matrix cannot be a zero matrix.Constraints:m == mat.lengthn == mat[i].length1 <= m, n <= 3mat[i][j]is either0or1.
