Given arows x colsbinarymatrixfilled with0's and1's, find the largest rectangle containing only1's and returnits area.Example 1:Input:matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]Output:6Explanation:The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.Example 2:Input:matrix = [["0"]]Output:0Example 3:Input:matrix = [["1"]]Output:1Constraints:rows == matrix.lengthcols == matrix[i].length1 <= row, cols <= 200matrix[i][j]is'0'or'1'.
