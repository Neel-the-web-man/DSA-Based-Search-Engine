Given two stringssandp, return an array of all the start indices ofp'sanagramsins. You may return the answer inany order.Example 1:Input:s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"Output:[0,6]Explanation:The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".Example 2:Input:s = "abab", p = "ab"Output:[0,1,2]Explanation:The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".Constraints:1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104sandpconsist of lowercase English letters.
