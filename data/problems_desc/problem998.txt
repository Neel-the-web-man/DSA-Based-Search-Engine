There arennncities andmmmroads between them. Kaaleppi is currently in cityaaaand wants to travel to citybbb.However, there is a problem: Kaaleppi has recently robbed a bank in citycccand can't enter the city, because the local police would catch him. Your task is to find out if there is a route from cityaaato citybbbthat does not visit cityccc.As an additional challenge, you have to processqqqqueries whereaaa,bbbandcccvary.InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmmandqqq: the number of cities, roads and queries. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Then, there aremmmlines describing the roads. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is a road between citiesaaaandbbb. Each road is bidirectional.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. Each line has three integersaaa,bbbandccc: is there a route from cityaaato citybbbthat does not visit cityccc?You can assume that there is a route between any two cities.OutputFor each query, print "YES", if there is such a route, and "NO" otherwise.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤q≤1051 \le q \le 10^51≤q≤1051≤a,b,c≤n1 \le a,b,c \le n1≤a,b,c≤nExampleInput:5 6 3
