Given a stringsand an array of stringswords, returnthe number ofwords[i]that is a subsequence ofs.Asubsequenceof a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.For example,"ace"is a subsequence of"abcde".Example 1:Input:s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]Output:3Explanation:There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".Example 2:Input:s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]Output:2Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 5 * 1041 <= words.length <= 50001 <= words[i].length <= 50sandwords[i]consist of only lowercase English letters.
