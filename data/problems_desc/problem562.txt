You start with an initialpowerofpower, an initialscoreof0, and a bag of tokens given as an integer arraytokens, where eachtokens[i]denotes the value of tokeni.Your goal is tomaximizethe totalscoreby strategically playing these tokens. In one move, you can play anunplayedtoken in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):Face-up: If your current power isat leasttokens[i], you may play tokeni, losingtokens[i]power and gaining1score.Face-down: If your current score isat least1, you may play tokeni, gainingtokens[i]power and losing1score.Returnthemaximumpossible score you can achieve after playinganynumber of tokens.Example 1:Input:tokens = [100], power = 50Output:0Explanation:Since your score is0initially, you cannot play the token face-down. You also cannot play it face-up since your power (50) is less thantokens[0](100).Example 2:Input:tokens = [200,100], power = 150Output:1Explanation:Play token1(100) face-up, reducing your power to50and increasing your score to1.There is no need to play token0, since you cannot play it face-up to add to your score. The maximum score achievable is1.Example 3:Input:tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200Output:2Explanation:Play the tokens in this order to get a score of2:Play token0(100) face-up, reducing power to100and increasing score to1.Play token3(400) face-down, increasing power to500and reducing score to0.Play token1(200) face-up, reducing power to300and increasing score to1.Play token2(300) face-up, reducing power to0and increasing score to2.The maximum score achievable is2.Constraints:0 <= tokens.length <= 10000 <= tokens[i], power < 104
