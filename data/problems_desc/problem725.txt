A factory hasnnnmachines which can be used to make products. Your goal is to make a total oftttproducts.For each machine, you know the number of seconds it needs to make a single product. The machines can work simultaneously, and you can freely decide their schedule.What is the shortest time needed to maketttproducts?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandttt: the number of machines and products.The next line hasnnnintegersk1,k2,…,knk_1,k_2,\dots,k_nk1​,k2​,…,kn​: the time needed to make a product using each machine.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum time needed to maketttproducts.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤t≤1091 \le t \le 10^91≤t≤1091≤ki≤1091 \le k_i \le 10^91≤ki​≤109ExampleInput:3 7
