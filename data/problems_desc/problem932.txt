There arennncities in Byteland but no roads between them. However, each day, a new road will be built. There will be a total ofmmmroads.Your task is to processqqqqueries of the form: "after how many days can we travel from cityaaato citybbbfor the first time?"InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmmandqqq: the number of cities, roads and queries. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aremmmlines that describe the roads in the order they are built. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there will be a road between citiesaaaandbbb.Finally, there areqqqlines that describe the queries. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: we want to travel from cityaaato citybbb.OutputFor each query, print the number of days, or−1-1−1if it is never possible.Constraints1≤n,m,q≤2⋅1051 \le n, m, q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,m,q≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5 4 3
