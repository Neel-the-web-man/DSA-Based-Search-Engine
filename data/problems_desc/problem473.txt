You are given a binary strings. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:Type-1: Removethe character at the start of the stringsandappendit to the end of the string.Type-2: Pickany character insandflipits value, i.e., if its value is'0'it becomes'1'and vice-versa.Returntheminimumnumber oftype-2operations you need to performsuch thatsbecomesalternating.The string is calledalternatingif no two adjacent characters are equal.For example, the strings"010"and"1010"are alternating, while the string"0100"is not.Example 1:Input:s = "111000"Output:2Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "101010".Example 2:Input:s = "010"Output:0Explanation: The string is already alternating.Example 3:Input:s = "1110"Output:1Explanation: Use the second operation on the second element to make s = "1010".Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 105s[i]is either'0'or'1'.
