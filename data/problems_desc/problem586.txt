There arenpeople that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with aunique IDfrom0ton - 1.You are given an integer arraygroupSizes, wheregroupSizes[i]is the size of the group that personiis in. For example, ifgroupSizes[1] = 3, then person1must be in a group of size3.Returna list of groups such that each personiis in a group of sizegroupSizes[i].Each person should appear inexactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers,return any of them. It isguaranteedthat there will beat least onevalid solution for the given input.Example 1:Input:groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]Output:[[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]Explanation:The first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
The second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
The third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].Example 2:Input:groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]Output:[[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]Constraints:groupSizes.length == n1 <= n <= 5001 <= groupSizes[i] <= n
