You would like to find the nearest anime shop that is not in your city.For each city, determine the minimum distance to another city that has an anime shop.InputThe first line has three integersnnn,mmmandkkk: the number of cities, roads and anime shops. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.The next line containskkkintegers: the cities that have an anime shop.Finally, there aremmmlines that describe the roads. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is a road between citiesaaaandbbb.OutputPrintnnnintegers: for each city, the minimum distance to another city with an anime shop. If there is no such city, print−1-1−1instead.Constraints1≤k≤n≤1051 \le k \le n \le 10^51≤k≤n≤1050≤m≤2⋅1050 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^50≤m≤2⋅105ExampleInput:9 6 4
