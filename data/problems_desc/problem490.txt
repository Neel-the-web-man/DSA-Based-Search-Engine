You are given an integer arraynumsand an integerk. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays ofnumsthat meet the following conditions:The length of the subarray isk, andAll the elements of the subarray aredistinct.Returnthe maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions.If no subarray meets the conditions, return0.Asubarrayis a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3Output:15Explanation:The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditionsExample 2:Input:nums = [4,4,4], k = 3Output:0Explanation:The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.Constraints:1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 105
