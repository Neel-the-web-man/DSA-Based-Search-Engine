A game consists ofnnnrooms andmmmteleporters. At the beginning of each day, you start in room111and you have to reach roomnnn.You can use each teleporter at most once during the game. You want to play the game for exactlykkkdays. Every time you use any teleporter you have to pay one coin. What is the minimum number of coins you have to pay duringkkkdays if you play optimally?InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmmandkkk: the number of rooms, the number of teleporters and the number of days you play the game. The rooms are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aremmmlines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is a teleporter from roomaaato roombbb.There are no two teleporters whose starting and ending room are the same.OutputFirst print one integer: the minimum number of coins you have to pay if you play optimally. Then, printkkkroute descriptions according to the example. You can print any valid solution.If it is not possible to play the game forkkkdays, print only -1.Constraints2≤n≤5002 \le n \le 5002≤n≤5001≤m≤10001 \le m \le 10001≤m≤10001≤k≤n−11 \le k \le n-11≤k≤n−11≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:8 10 2
