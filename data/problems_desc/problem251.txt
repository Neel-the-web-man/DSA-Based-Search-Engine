Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.The encoding rule is:k[encoded_string], where theencoded_stringinside the square brackets is being repeated exactlyktimes. Note thatkis guaranteed to be a positive integer.You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers,k. For example, there will not be input like3aor2[4].The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed105.Example 1:Input:s = "3[a]2[bc]"Output:"aaabcbc"Example 2:Input:s = "3[a2[c]]"Output:"accaccacc"Example 3:Input:s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"Output:"abcabccdcdcdef"Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 30sconsists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets'[]'.sis guaranteed to bea validinput.All the integers insare in the range[1, 300].
