Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that in the resulting directed graph each node has an even outdegree. The outdegree of a node is the number of edges coming out of that node.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aremmmlines describing the edges. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb.You may assume that the graph is simple, i.e., there is at most one edge between any two nodes and every edge connects two distinct nodes.OutputPrintmmmlines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge from nodeaaato nodebbb. You can print any valid solution.If there are no solutions, only printIMPOSSIBLE.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:4 4
