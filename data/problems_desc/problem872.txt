There is a staircase consisting ofnnnstairs, numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n. Initially, each stair has some number of balls.There are two players who move alternately. On each move, a player chooses a stairkkkwherek≠1k \neq 1k=1and it has at least one ball. Then, the player moves any number of balls from stairkkkto stairk−1k-1k−1. The player who moves last wins the game.Your task is to find out who wins the game when both players play optimally.Note that if there are no possible moves at all, the second player wins.InputThe first input line has an integerttt: the number of tests. After this,ttttest cases are described:The first line contains an integernnn: the number of stairs.The next line hasnnnintegersp1,p2,…,pnp_1,p_2,\ldots,p_np1​,p2​,…,pn​: the initial number of balls on each stair.OutputFor each test, print "first" if the first player wins the game and "second" if the second player wins the game.Constraints1≤t≤2⋅1051 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤t≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1050≤pi≤1090 \le p_i \le 10^90≤pi​≤109the sum of allnnnis at most2⋅1052 \cdot 10^52⋅105ExampleInput:3
