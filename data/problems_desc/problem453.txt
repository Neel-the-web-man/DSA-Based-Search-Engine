Given a strings, return the maximum number of occurrences ofanysubstring under the following rules:The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal tomaxLetters.The substring size must be betweenminSizeandmaxSizeinclusive.Example 1:Input:s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4Output:2Explanation:Substring "aab" has 2 occurrences in the original string.
It satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize).Example 2:Input:s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3Output:2Explanation:Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 1051 <= maxLetters <= 261 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)sconsists of only lowercase English letters.
