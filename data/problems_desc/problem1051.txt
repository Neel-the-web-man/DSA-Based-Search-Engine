There is a knight on an infinite chessboard. The rows and columns are111-indexed.Your task is to efficiently process queries of the form: when the knight starts at position(x,y)(x,y)(x,y), what is the minimum number of moves the knight needs to do to reach the top-left corner.InputThe first line has an integernnn: the number of queries.After this, there arennnlines. Each line has two integersxxxandyyy: the knight position.OutputFor each query, print the minimum number of moves.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤x,y≤1091 \le x, y \le 10^91≤x,y≤109ExampleInput:4
