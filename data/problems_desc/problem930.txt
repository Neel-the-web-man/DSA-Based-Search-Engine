You are given a binary string of lengthnnn. Your task is to calculate, for everykkkbetween1…n−11 \ldots n-11…n−1, the number of ways we can choose two positionsiiiandjjjsuch thati−j=ki-j=ki−j=kand there is a one-bit at both positions.InputThe only input line has a string that consists only of characters000and111.OutputFor every distancekkkbetween1…n−11\ldots n-11…n−1print the number of ways we can choose two such positions.Constraints2≤n≤2⋅1052 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^52≤n≤2⋅105ExampleInput:1001011010Output:1 2 3 0 2 1 0 1 0
