Anugly numberis a positive integer that is divisible bya,b, orc.Given four integersn,a,b, andc, return thenthugly number.Example 1:Input:n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5Output:4Explanation:The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rdis 4.Example 2:Input:n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4Output:6Explanation:The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4this 6.Example 3:Input:n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13Output:10Explanation:The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5this 10.Constraints:1 <= n, a, b, c <= 1091 <= a * b * c <= 1018It is guaranteed that the result will be in range[1, 2 * 109].
