You are given an array ofnnnintegers. Your task is to calculate the median of each window ofkkkelements, from left to right.The median is the middle element when the elements are sorted. If the number of elements is even, there are two possible medians and we assume that the median is the smaller of them.InputThe first line contains two integersnnnandkkk: the number of elements and the size of the window.Then there arennnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the array.OutputPrintn−k+1n-k+1n−k+1values: the medians.Constraints1≤k≤n≤2⋅1051 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤k≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤109ExampleInput:8 3
