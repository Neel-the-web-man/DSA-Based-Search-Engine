You are given ann×nn \times nn×ngrid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or has a tree. Your task is to processqqqqueries of the following types:Change the state (empty/tree) of a square.How many trees are inside a rectangle in the forest?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandqqq: the size of the forest and the number of queries.Then, there arennnlines describing the forest. Each line hasnnncharacters:.is an empty square and*is a tree.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "111yyyxxx" or "2y1y_1y1​x1x_1x1​y2y_2y2​x2x_2x2​".OutputPrint the answer to each query of the second type.Constraints1≤n≤10001 \le n \le 10001≤n≤10001≤q≤2⋅1051 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤q≤2⋅1051≤y,x≤n1 \le y,x \le n1≤y,x≤n1≤y1≤y2≤n1 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le n1≤y1​≤y2​≤n1≤x1≤x2≤n1 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le n1≤x1​≤x2​≤nExampleInput:4 3
