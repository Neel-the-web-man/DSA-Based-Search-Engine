You are given an integer arraynumsthat issorted in non-decreasing order.Determine if it is possible to splitnumsintoone or more subsequencessuch thatbothof the following conditions are true:Each subsequence is aconsecutive increasing sequence(i.e. each integer isexactly onemore than the previous integer).All subsequences have a length of3or more.Returntrueif you can splitnumsaccording to the above conditions, orfalseotherwise.Asubsequenceof an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e.,[1,3,5]is a subsequence of[1,2,3,4,5]while[1,3,2]is not).Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]Output:trueExplanation:nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5Example 2:Input:nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]Output:trueExplanation:nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5Example 3:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]Output:falseExplanation:It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 104-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000numsis sorted innon-decreasingorder.
