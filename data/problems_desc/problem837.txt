Given a tree ofnnnnodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that have at leastk1k_1k1​and at mostk2k_2k2​edges.InputThe first input line contains three integersnnn,k1k_1k1​andk2k_2k2​: the number of nodes and the path lengths. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n.Then there aren−1n-1n−1lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb.OutputPrint one integer: the number of paths.Constraints1≤k1≤k2≤n≤2⋅1051 \le k_1 \le k_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤k1​≤k2​≤n≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5 2 3
