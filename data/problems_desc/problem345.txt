Given an array of positive integersnumsand a positive integertarget, returntheminimal lengthof asubarraywhose sum is greater than or equal totarget. If there is no such subarray, return0instead.Example 1:Input:target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]Output:2Explanation:The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.Example 2:Input:target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]Output:1Example 3:Input:target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]Output:0Constraints:1 <= target <= 1091 <= nums.length <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 104Follow up:If you have figured out theO(n)solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity isO(n log(n)).
