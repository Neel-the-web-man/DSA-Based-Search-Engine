Find all valid combinations ofknumbers that sum up tonsuch that the following conditions are true:Only numbers1through9are used.Each number is usedat most once.Returna list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.Example 1:Input:k = 3, n = 7Output:[[1,2,4]]Explanation:1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.Example 2:Input:k = 3, n = 9Output:[[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]Explanation:1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.Example 3:Input:k = 4, n = 1Output:[]Explanation:There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.Constraints:2 <= k <= 91 <= n <= 60
