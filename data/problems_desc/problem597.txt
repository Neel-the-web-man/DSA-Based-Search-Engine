Given a positive integern, write a function that returns the number ofset bitsin its binary representation (also known as theHamming weight).Example 1:Input:n = 11Output:3Explanation:The input binary string1011has a total of three set bits.Example 2:Input:n = 128Output:1Explanation:The input binary string10000000has a total of one set bit.Example 3:Input:n = 2147483645Output:30Explanation:The input binary string1111111111111111111111111111101has a total of thirty set bits.Constraints:1 <= n <= 231- 1Follow up:If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
