You are given an array of integersnums, there is a sliding window of sizekwhich is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see theknumbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.Returnthe max sliding window.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3Output:[3,3,5,5,6,7]Explanation:Window position                Max
