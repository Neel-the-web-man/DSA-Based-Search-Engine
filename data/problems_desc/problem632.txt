You are given an integer arraynums.You should move each element ofnumsinto one of the two arraysAandBsuch thatAandBare non-empty, andaverage(A) == average(B).Returntrueif it is possible to achieve that andfalseotherwise.Notethat for an arrayarr,average(arr)is the sum of all the elements ofarrover the length ofarr.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]Output:trueExplanation:We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have an average of 4.5.Example 2:Input:nums = [3,1]Output:falseConstraints:1 <= nums.length <= 300 <= nums[i] <= 104
