We consider a string ofnnncharacters, indexed1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n. Your task is to calculate all values of the following functions:z(i)z(i)z(i)denotes the maximum length of a substring that begins at positioniiiand is a prefix of the string. In addition,z(1)=0z(1)=0z(1)=0.π(i)\pi(i)π(i)denotes the maximum length of a substring that ends at positioniii, is a prefix of the string, and whose length is at mosti−1i-1i−1.Note that the functionzzzis used in the Z-algorithm, and the functionπ\piπis used in the KMP algorithm.InputThe only input line has a string of lengthnnn. Each character is between a–z.OutputPrint two lines: first the values of thezzzfunction, and then the values of theπ\piπfunction.Constraints1≤n≤1061 \le n \le 10^61≤n≤106ExampleInput:abaabcaOutput:0 0 1 2 0 0 1
