You are given an arraypairs, wherepairs[i] = [xi, yi], and:There are no duplicates.xi< yiLetwaysbe the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared inpairs.A pair[xi, yi]exists inpairsif and only ifxiis an ancestor ofyioryiis an ancestor ofxi.Note:the tree does not have to be a binary tree.Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.Return:0ifways == 01ifways == 12ifways > 1Arooted treeis a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.Anancestorof a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.Example 1:Input:pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]Output:1Explanation:There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.Example 2:Input:pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3]]Output:2Explanation:There are multiple valid rooted trees. Three of them are shown in the above figures.Example 3:Input:pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[1,5]]Output:0Explanation:There are no valid rooted trees.Constraints:1 <= pairs.length <= 1051 <= xi< yi<= 500The elements inpairsare unique.
