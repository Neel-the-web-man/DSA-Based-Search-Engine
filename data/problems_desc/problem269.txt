There is anundirectedgraph withnnodes, where each node is numbered between0andn - 1. You are given a 2D arraygraph, wheregraph[u]is an array of nodes that nodeuis adjacent to. More formally, for eachvingraph[u], there is an undirected edge between nodeuand nodev. The graph has the following properties:There are no self-edges (graph[u]does not containu).There are no parallel edges (graph[u]does not contain duplicate values).Ifvis ingraph[u], thenuis ingraph[v](the graph is undirected).The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodesuandvsuch that there is no path between them.A graph isbipartiteif the nodes can be partitioned into two independent setsAandBsuch thateveryedge in the graph connects a node in setAand a node in setB.Returntrueif and only if it isbipartite.Example 1:Input:graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]Output:falseExplanation:There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.Example 2:Input:graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]Output:trueExplanation:We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.Constraints:graph.length == n1 <= n <= 1000 <= graph[u].length < n0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1graph[u]does not containu.All the values ofgraph[u]areunique.Ifgraph[u]containsv, thengraph[v]containsu.
