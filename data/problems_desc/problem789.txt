Your task is to construct a minimum-length bit string that contains all possible substrings of lengthnnn. For example, whenn=2n=2n=2, the string 00110 is a valid solution, because its substrings of length222are 00, 01, 10 and 11.InputThe only input line has an integernnn.OutputPrint a minimum-length bit string that contains all substrings of lengthnnn. You can print any valid solution.Constraints1≤n≤151 \le n \le 151≤n≤15ExampleInput:2Output:00110
