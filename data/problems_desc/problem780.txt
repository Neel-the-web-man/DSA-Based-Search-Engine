You are playing a game consisting of n planets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself).You have to processqqqqueries of the form: You are now on planetaaaand want to reach planetbbb. What is the minimum number of teleportations?InputThe first input line contains two integersnnnandqqq: the number of planets and queries. The planets are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n.The second line containsnnnintegerst1,t2,…,tnt_1,t_2,\ldots,t_nt1​,t2​,…,tn​: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: you are now on planetaaaand want to reach planetbbb.OutputFor each query, print the minimum number of teleportations. If it is not possible to reach the destination, print−1-1−1.Constraints1≤n,q≤2⋅1051 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,q≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5 3
