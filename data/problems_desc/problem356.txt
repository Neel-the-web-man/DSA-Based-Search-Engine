Given two integer arraysnums1andnums2, returnan array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result inany order.Example 1:Input:nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]Output:[2,2]Example 2:Input:nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]Output:[4,9]Explanation:[9,4] is also accepted.Constraints:1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 10000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000Follow up:What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?What ifnums1's size is small compared tonums2's size? Which algorithm is better?What if elements ofnums2are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
