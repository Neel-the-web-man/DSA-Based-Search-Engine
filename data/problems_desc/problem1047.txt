You are given a cyclic array consisting ofnnnvalues. Each element has two neighbors; the elements at positionsnnnand111are also considered neighbors.Your task is to divide the array into subarrays so that the sum of each subarray is at mostkkk. What is the minimum number of subarrays?InputThe first input line contains integersnnnandkkk.The next line hasnnnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the array.There is always at least one division (i.e., no value in the array is larger thankkk).OutputPrint one integer: the minimum number of subarrays.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤1091≤k≤10181 \le k \le 10^{18}1≤k≤1018ExampleInput:8 5
2 2 2 1 3 1 2 1Output:3Explanation: We can create three subarrays:[2,2,1][2,2,1][2,2,1],[3,1][3,1][3,1], and[2,1,2][2,1,2][2,1,2](remember that the array is cyclic).
