You are given an array of positive integersnumsand want to erase a subarray containingunique elements. Thescoreyou get by erasing the subarray is equal to thesumof its elements.Returnthemaximum scoreyou can get by erasingexactly onesubarray.An arraybis called to be asubarrayofaif it forms a contiguous subsequence ofa, that is, if it is equal toa[l],a[l+1],...,a[r]for some(l,r).Example 1:Input:nums = [4,2,4,5,6]Output:17Explanation:The optimal subarray here is [2,4,5,6].Example 2:Input:nums = [5,2,1,2,5,2,1,2,5]Output:8Explanation:The optimal subarray here is [5,2,1] or [1,2,5].Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 104
