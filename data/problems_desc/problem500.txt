You are given a0-indexedarraynumsand anon-negativeintegerk.In one operation, you can do the following:Choose an indexithathasn't been chosen beforefrom the range[0, nums.length - 1].Replacenums[i]with any integer from the range[nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k].Thebeautyof the array is the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements.Returnthemaximumpossible beauty of the arraynumsafter applying the operation any number of times.Notethat you can apply the operation to each indexonly once.Asubsequenceof an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.Example 1:Input:nums = [4,6,1,2], k = 2Output:3Explanation:In this example, we apply the following operations:
- Choose index 1, replace it with 4 (from range [4,8]), nums = [4,4,1,2].
- Choose index 3, replace it with 4 (from range [0,4]), nums = [4,4,1,4].
After the applied operations, the beauty of the array nums is 3 (subsequence consisting of indices 0, 1, and 3).
It can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible length we can achieve.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,1,1,1], k = 10Output:4Explanation:In this example we don't have to apply any operations.
The beauty of the array nums is 4 (whole array).Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1050 <= nums[i], k <= 105
