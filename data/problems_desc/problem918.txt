Given a string, your task is to process operations where you cut a substring and paste it to the end of the string. What is the final string after all the operations?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the length of the string and the number of operations. The characters of the string are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.The next line has a string of lengthnnnthat consists of characters A–Z.Finally, there aremmmlines that describe the operations. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: you cut a substring from positionaaato positionbbb.OutputPrint the final string after all the operations.Constraints1≤n,m≤2⋅1051 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,m≤2⋅1051≤a≤b≤n1 \le a \le b \le n1≤a≤b≤nExampleInput:7 2
