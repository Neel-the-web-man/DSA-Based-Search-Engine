Alice and Bob have a different total number of candies. You are given two integer arraysaliceSizesandbobSizeswherealiceSizes[i]is the number of candies of theithbox of candy that Alice has andbobSizes[j]is the number of candies of thejthbox of candy that Bob has.Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy box each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy. The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the number of candies in each box they have.Return an integer arrayanswerwhereanswer[0]is the number of candies in the box that Alice must exchange, andanswer[1]is the number of candies in the box that Bob must exchange. If there are multiple answers, you mayreturn anyone of them. It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.Example 1:Input:aliceSizes = [1,1], bobSizes = [2,2]Output:[1,2]Example 2:Input:aliceSizes = [1,2], bobSizes = [2,3]Output:[1,2]Example 3:Input:aliceSizes = [2], bobSizes = [1,3]Output:[2,3]Constraints:1 <= aliceSizes.length, bobSizes.length <= 1041 <= aliceSizes[i], bobSizes[j] <= 105Alice and Bob have a different total number of candies.There will be at least one valid answer for the given input.
