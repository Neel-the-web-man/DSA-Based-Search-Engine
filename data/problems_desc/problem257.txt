There are a total ofnumCoursescourses you have to take, labeled from0tonumCourses - 1. You are given an arrayprerequisiteswhereprerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]indicates that youmusttake coursebifirst if you want to take courseai.For example, the pair[0, 1], indicates that to take course0you have to first take course1.Returntrueif you can finish all courses. Otherwise, returnfalse.Example 1:Input:numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]Output:trueExplanation:There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.Example 2:Input:numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]Output:falseExplanation:There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.Constraints:1 <= numCourses <= 20000 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000prerequisites[i].length == 20 <= ai, bi< numCoursesAll the pairs prerequisites[i] areunique.
