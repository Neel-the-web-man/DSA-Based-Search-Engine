Your task is to find all possible alternatives for the number of children that will visit Korkeasaari. The children's wishes have to be taken into account.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of children and their wishes. The children are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aremmmlines describing the children's wishes. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: childrenaaaandbbbwant to visit the same attraction.OutputPrint a bit string of lengthnnnwhere a one-bit at indexiiiindicates that it is possible that exactlyiiichildren visit Korkeasaari (the bit string is to be considered one-indexed).Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1050≤m≤1050 \le m \le 10^50≤m≤1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5 3
