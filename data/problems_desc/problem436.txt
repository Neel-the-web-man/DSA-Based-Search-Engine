Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game"21".Alice starts with0points and draws numbers while she has less thankpoints. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range[1, maxPts], wheremaxPtsis an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.Alice stops drawing numbers when she getskor more points.Return the probability that Alice hasnor fewer points.Answers within10-5of the actual answer are considered accepted.Example 1:Input:n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10Output:1.00000Explanation:Alice gets a single card, then stops.Example 2:Input:n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10Output:0.60000Explanation:Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.Example 3:Input:n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10Output:0.73278Constraints:0 <= k <= n <= 1041 <= maxPts <= 104
