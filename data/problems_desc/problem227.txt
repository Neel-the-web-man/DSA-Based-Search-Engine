Given a stringsrepresenting a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and returnthe result of the evaluation.Note:You arenotallowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such aseval().Example 1:Input:s = "1 + 1"Output:2Example 2:Input:s = " 2-1 + 2 "Output:3Example 3:Input:s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"Output:23Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105sconsists of digits,'+','-','(',')', and' '.srepresents a valid expression.'+'isnotused as a unary operation (i.e.,"+1"and"+(2 + 3)"is invalid).'-'could be used as a unary operation (i.e.,"-1"and"-(2 + 3)"is valid).There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
