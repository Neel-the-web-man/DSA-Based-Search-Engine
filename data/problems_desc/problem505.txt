You are given an integer arraypriceswhereprices[i]is the price of a given stock on theithday.On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only holdat most oneshare of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on thesame day.Find and returnthemaximumprofit you can achieve.Example 1:Input:prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]Output:7Explanation:Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.Example 2:Input:prices = [1,2,3,4,5]Output:4Explanation:Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.Example 3:Input:prices = [7,6,4,3,1]Output:0Explanation:There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.Constraints:1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 1040 <= prices[i] <= 104
