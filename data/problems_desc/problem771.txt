Your task is to find a minimum-price flight route from Syrjälä to Metsälä. You have one discount coupon, using which you can halve the price of any single flight during the route. However, you can only use the coupon once.When you use the discount coupon for a flight whose price isxxx, its price becomes⌊x/2⌋\lfloor x/2 \rfloor⌊x/2⌋(it is rounded down to an integer).InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of cities and flight connections. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n. City 1 is Syrjälä, and citynnnis Metsälä.After this there aremmmlines describing the flights. Each line has three integersaaa,bbb, andccc: a flight begins at cityaaa, ends at citybbb, and its price isccc. Each flight is unidirectional.You can assume that it is always possible to get from Syrjälä to Metsälä.OutputPrint one integer: the price of the cheapest route from Syrjälä to Metsälä.Constraints2≤n≤1052 \le n \le 10^52≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤c≤1091 \le c \le 10^91≤c≤109ExampleInput:3 4
