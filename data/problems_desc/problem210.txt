Atransformation sequencefrom wordbeginWordto wordendWordusing a dictionarywordListis a sequence of wordsbeginWord -> s1-> s2-> ... -> sksuch that:Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.Everysifor1 <= i <= kis inwordList. Note thatbeginWorddoes not need to be inwordList.sk== endWordGiven two words,beginWordandendWord, and a dictionarywordList, returnthenumber of wordsin theshortest transformation sequencefrombeginWordtoendWord, or0if no such sequence exists.Example 1:Input:beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]Output:5Explanation:One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.Example 2:Input:beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]Output:0Explanation:The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.Constraints:1 <= beginWord.length <= 10endWord.length == beginWord.length1 <= wordList.length <= 5000wordList[i].length == beginWord.lengthbeginWord,endWord, andwordList[i]consist of lowercase English letters.beginWord != endWordAll the words inwordListareunique.
