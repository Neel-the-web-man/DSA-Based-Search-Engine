For each press, you may pickanyof the four buttons to press.Given the two integersnandpresses, returnthe number ofdifferent possible statusesafter performing allpressesbutton presses.Example 1:Input:n = 1, presses = 1Output:2Explanation:Status can be:
- [off] by pressing button 1
- [on] by pressing button 2Example 2:Input:n = 2, presses = 1Output:3Explanation:Status can be:
- [off, off] by pressing button 1
- [on, off] by pressing button 2
- [off, on] by pressing button 3Example 3:Input:n = 3, presses = 1Output:4Explanation:Status can be:
- [off, off, off] by pressing button 1
- [off, on, off] by pressing button 2
- [on, off, on] by pressing button 3
- [off, on, on] by pressing button 4Constraints:1 <= n <= 10000 <= presses <= 1000
