You are given a string that consists ofnnncharacters between a–z. The positions of the string are indexed1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Your task is to processmmmoperations of the following types:Change the character at positionkkktoxxxCheck if the substring from positionaaato positionbbbis a palindromeInputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the length of the string and the number of operations.The next line has a string that consists ofnnncharacters.Finally, there aremmmlines that describe the operations. Each line is of the form "1kkkxxx" or "2aaabbb".OutputFor each operation 2, print YES if the substring is a palindrome and NO otherwise.Constraints1≤n,m≤2⋅1051 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,m≤2⋅1051≤k≤n1 \le k \le n1≤k≤n1≤a≤b≤n1 \le a \le b \le n1≤a≤b≤nExampleInput:7 5
