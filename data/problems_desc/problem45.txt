You are givennballoons, indexed from0ton - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an arraynums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.If you burst theithballoon, you will getnums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]coins. Ifi - 1ori + 1goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a1painted on it.Returnthe maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.Example 1:Input:nums = [3,1,5,8]Output:167Explanation:nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167Example 2:Input:nums = [1,5]Output:10Constraints:n == nums.length1 <= n <= 3000 <= nums[i] <= 100
