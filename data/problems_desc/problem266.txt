You are given a network ofnnodes, labeled from1ton. You are also giventimes, a list of travel times as directed edgestimes[i] = (ui, vi, wi), whereuiis the source node,viis the target node, andwiis the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.We will send a signal from a given nodek. Returntheminimumtime it takes for all thennodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all thennodes to receive the signal, return-1.Example 1:Input:times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2Output:2Example 2:Input:times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1Output:1Example 3:Input:times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2Output:-1Constraints:1 <= k <= n <= 1001 <= times.length <= 6000times[i].length == 31 <= ui, vi<= nui!= vi0 <= wi<= 100All the pairs(ui, vi)areunique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)
