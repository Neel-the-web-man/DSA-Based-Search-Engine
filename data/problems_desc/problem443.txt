Given a binary arraynumsand an integerk, returnthe maximum number of consecutive1's in the array if you can flip at mostk0's.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2Output:6Explanation:[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.Example 2:Input:nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3Output:10Explanation:[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 105nums[i]is either0or1.0 <= k <= nums.length
