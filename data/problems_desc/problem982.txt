A computer network hasnnncomputers andn−1n-1n−1connections between two computers. Information can be exchanged between every pair of computers using the connections.Each connection has a certain transfer speed. Letd(a,b)d(a,b)d(a,b)denote the transfer speed between computersaaaandbbb, which is the speed of the slowest connection on the route betweenaaaandbbb. Your task is to compute the sum of transfer speeds between all pairs of computers.InputThe first line contains the integernnn: the number of computers. The computers are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aren−1n-1n−1lines, which describe the connections. Each line has three integersaaa,bbbandxxx: there is a connection between computersaaaandbbbwith transfer speedxxx.OutputPrint one integer: the sum of transfer speeds.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤x≤1061 \le x \le 10^61≤x≤106ExampleInput:4
