You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks containsone less blockthan the row beneath it and is centered on top.To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specifictriangular patternsthat are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of asingle blockstacked on top oftwo blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter stringsallowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.For example,"ABC"represents a triangular pattern with a'C'block stacked on top of an'A'(left) and'B'(right) block. Note that this is different from"BAC"where'B'is on the left bottom and'A'is on the right bottom.You start with a bottom row of blocksbottom, given as a single string, that youmustuse as the base of the pyramid.Givenbottomandallowed, returntrueif you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such thatevery triangular patternin the pyramid is inallowed, orfalseotherwise.Example 1:Input:bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCC","CDE","CEA","FFF"]Output:trueExplanation:The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.
Starting from the bottom (level 3), we can build "CE" on level 2 and then build "A" on level 1.
There are three triangular patterns in the pyramid, which are "BCC", "CDE", and "CEA". All are allowed.Example 2:Input:bottom = "AAAA", allowed = ["AAB","AAC","BCD","BBE","DEF"]Output:falseExplanation:The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.
Starting from the bottom (level 4), there are multiple ways to build level 3, but trying all the possibilites, you will get always stuck before building level 1.Constraints:2 <= bottom.length <= 60 <= allowed.length <= 216allowed[i].length == 3The letters in all input strings are from the set{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'}.All the values ofallowedareunique.
