You are given an integer arraynums. In one operation, you can replaceanyelement innumswithanyinteger.numsis consideredcontinuousif both of the following conditions are fulfilled:All elements innumsareunique.The difference between themaximumelement and theminimumelement innumsequalsnums.length - 1.For example,nums = [4, 2, 5, 3]iscontinuous, butnums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]isnot continuous.Returntheminimumnumber of operations to makenumscontinuous.Example 1:Input:nums = [4,2,5,3]Output:0Explanation:nums is already continuous.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,2,3,5,6]Output:1Explanation:One possible solution is to change the last element to 4.
The resulting array is [1,2,3,5,4], which is continuous.Example 3:Input:nums = [1,10,100,1000]Output:3Explanation:One possible solution is to:
- Change the second element to 2.
- Change the third element to 3.
- Change the fourth element to 4.
The resulting array is [1,2,3,4], which is continuous.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 109
