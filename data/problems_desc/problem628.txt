Given two integersleftandright, returnthecountof numbers in theinclusiverange[left, right]having aprime number of set bitsin their binary representation.Recall that thenumber of set bitsan integer has is the number of1's present when written in binary.For example,21written in binary is10101, which has3set bits.Example 1:Input:left = 6, right = 10Output:4Explanation:6  -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7  -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
8  -> 1000 (1 set bit, 1 is not prime)
9  -> 1001 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
4 numbers have a prime number of set bits.Example 2:Input:left = 10, right = 15Output:5Explanation:10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.Constraints:1 <= left <= right <= 1060 <= right - left <= 104
