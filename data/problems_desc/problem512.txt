Given a sorted integer arraynumsand an integern, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range[1, n]inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.Returnthe minimum number of patches required.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,3], n = 6Output:1
Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,5,10], n = 20Output:2
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].Example 3:Input:nums = [1,2,2], n = 5Output:0Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 10001 <= nums[i] <= 104numsis sorted inascending order.1 <= n <= 231- 1
