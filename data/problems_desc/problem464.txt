You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with acirculararraycodeof length ofnand a keyk.To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replacedsimultaneously.Ifk > 0, replace theithnumber with the sum of thenextknumbers.Ifk < 0, replace theithnumber with the sum of thepreviousknumbers.Ifk == 0, replace theithnumber with0.Ascodeis circular, the next element ofcode[n-1]iscode[0], and the previous element ofcode[0]iscode[n-1].Given thecirculararraycodeand an integer keyk, returnthe decrypted code to defuse the bomb!Example 1:Input:code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3Output:[12,10,16,13]Explanation:Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.Example 2:Input:code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0Output:[0,0,0,0]Explanation:When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0.Example 3:Input:code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2Output:[12,5,6,13]Explanation:The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of thepreviousnumbers.Constraints:n == code.length1 <= nÂ <= 1001 <= code[i] <= 100-(n - 1) <= k <= n - 1
