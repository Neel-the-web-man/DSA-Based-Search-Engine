There are some prizes on theX-axis. You are given an integer arrayprizePositionsthat issorted in non-decreasing order, whereprizePositions[i]is the position of theithprize. There could be different prizes at the same position on the line. You are also given an integerk.You are allowed to select two segments with integer endpoints. The length of each segment must bek. You will collect all prizes whose position falls within at least one of the two selected segments (including the endpoints of the segments). The two selected segments may intersect.For example ifk = 2, you can choose segments[1, 3]and[2, 4], and you will win any prizeithat satisfies1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 3or2 <= prizePositions[i] <= 4.Returnthemaximumnumber of prizes you can win if you choose the two segments optimally.Example 1:Input:prizePositions = [1,1,2,2,3,3,5], k = 2Output:7Explanation:In this example, you can win all 7 prizes by selecting two segments [1, 3] and [3, 5].Example 2:Input:prizePositions = [1,2,3,4], k = 0Output:2Explanation:For this example,one choicefor the segments is[3, 3]and[4, 4],and you will be able to get2prizes.Constraints:1 <= prizePositions.length <= 1051 <= prizePositions[i] <= 1090 <= k <= 109prizePositionsis sorted in non-decreasing order.
