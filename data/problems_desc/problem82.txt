Given anm x nbinary matrixmat, returnthe distance of the nearest0for each cell.The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is1.Example 1:Input:mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]Output:[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]Example 2:Input:mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]Output:[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]Constraints:m == mat.lengthn == mat[i].length1 <= m, n <= 1041 <= m * n <= 104mat[i][j]is either0or1.There is at least one0inmat.Note:This question is the same as 1765:https://leetcode.com/problems/map-of-highest-peak/
