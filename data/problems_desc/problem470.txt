A string is consideredbeautifulif it satisfies the following conditions:Each of the 5 English vowels ('a','e','i','o','u') must appearat least oncein it.The letters must be sorted inalphabetical order(i.e. all'a's before'e's, all'e's before'i's, etc.).For example, strings"aeiou"and"aaaaaaeiiiioou"are consideredbeautiful, but"uaeio","aeoiu", and"aaaeeeooo"arenot beautiful.Given a stringwordconsisting of English vowels, returnthelength of the longest beautiful substringofword. If no such substring exists, return0.Asubstringis a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.Example 1:Input:word = "aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"Output:13Explanation:The longest beautiful substring in word is "aaaaeiiiiouuu" of length 13.Example 2:Input:word = "aeeeiiiioooauuuaeiou"Output:5Explanation:The longest beautiful substring in word is "aeiou" of length 5.Example 3:Input:word = "a"Output:0Explanation:There is no beautiful substring, so return 0.Constraints:1 <= word.length <= 5 * 105wordconsists of characters'a','e','i','o', and'u'.
