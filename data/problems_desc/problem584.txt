Given the following details of a matrix withncolumns and2rows :The matrix is a binary matrix, which means each element in the matrix can be0or1.The sum of elements of the 0-th(upper) row is given asupper.The sum of elements of the 1-st(lower) row is given aslower.The sum of elements in the i-th column(0-indexed) iscolsum[i], wherecolsumis given as an integer array with lengthn.Your task is to reconstruct the matrix withupper,lowerandcolsum.Return it as a 2-D integer array.If there are more than one valid solution, any of them will be accepted.If no valid solution exists, return an empty 2-D array.Example 1:Input:upper = 2, lower = 1, colsum = [1,1,1]Output:[[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]Explanation:[[1,0,1],[0,1,0]], and [[0,1,1],[1,0,0]] are also correct answers.Example 2:Input:upper = 2, lower = 3, colsum = [2,2,1,1]Output:[]Example 3:Input:upper = 5, lower = 5, colsum = [2,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,1]Output:[[1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1]]Constraints:1 <= colsum.length <= 10^50 <= upper, lower <= colsum.length0 <= colsum[i] <= 2
