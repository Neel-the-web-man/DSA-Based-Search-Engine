Let the functionf(s)be thefrequency of the lexicographically smallest characterin a non-empty strings. For example, ifs = "dcce"thenf(s) = 2because the lexicographically smallest character is'c', which has a frequency of 2.You are given an array of stringswordsand another array of query stringsqueries. For each queryqueries[i], count thenumber of wordsinwordssuch thatf(queries[i])<f(W)for eachWinwords.Returnan integer arrayanswer, where eachanswer[i]is the answer to theithquery.Example 1:Input:queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]Output:[1]Explanation:On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").Example 2:Input:queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]Output:[1,2]Explanation:On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").Constraints:1 <= queries.length <= 20001 <= words.length <= 20001 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10queries[i][j],words[i][j]consist of lowercase English letters.
