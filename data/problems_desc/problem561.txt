You are given an integer arraynums. In one move, you can pick an indexiwhere0 <= i < nums.lengthand incrementnums[i]by1.Returnthe minimum number of moves to make every value innumsunique.The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,2]Output:1Explanation:After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].Example 2:Input:nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]Output:6Explanation:After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values with 5 or less moves.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1050 <= nums[i] <= 105
