You are given an array ofnnnintegers, and your task is to find four values (at distinct positions) whose sum isxxx.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandxxx: the array size and the target sum.The second line hasnnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\dots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​: the array values.OutputPrint four integers: the positions of the values. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, printIMPOSSIBLE.Constraints1≤n≤10001 \le n \le 10001≤n≤10001≤x,ai≤1091 \le x,a_i \le 10^91≤x,ai​≤109ExampleInput:8 15
