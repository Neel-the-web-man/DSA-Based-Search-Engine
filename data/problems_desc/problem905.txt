Givennnnhorizontal and vertical line segments, your task is to calculate the number of their intersection points.You can assume that no parallel line segments intersect, and no endpoint of a line segment is an intersection point.InputThe first line has an integernnn: the number of line segments.Then there arennnlines describing the line segments. Each line has four integers:x1x_1x1​,y1y_1y1​,x2x_2x2​andy2y_2y2​: a line segment begins at point(x1,y1)(x_1,y_1)(x1​,y1​)and ends at point(x2,y2)(x_2,y_2)(x2​,y2​).OutputPrint the number of intersection points.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤105−106≤x1≤x2≤106-10^6 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le 10^6−106≤x1​≤x2​≤106−106≤y1≤y2≤106-10^6 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le 10^6−106≤y1​≤y2​≤106(x1,y1)≠(x2,y2)(x_1,y_1) \neq (x_2,y_2)(x1​,y1​)=(x2​,y2​)ExampleInput:3
