Given anm x n2D binary gridgridwhich represents a map of'1's (land) and'0's (water), returnthe number of islands.Anislandis surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.Example 1:Input:grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]Output:1Example 2:Input:grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]Output:3Constraints:m == grid.lengthn == grid[i].length1 <= m, n <= 300grid[i][j]is'0'or'1'.
