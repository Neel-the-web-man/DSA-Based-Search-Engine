A company hasnnnemployees and there arennntasks that need to be done. We know for each employee the cost of carrying out each task. Every employee should be assigned to exactly one task. What is the minimum total cost if we assign the tasks optimally and how could they be assigned?InputThe first input line has one integernnn: the number of employees and the number of tasks that need to be done.After this, there arennnlines each consisting ofnnnintegers. Theiiith line consists of integersci1,ci2,…,cinc_{i1},c_{i2},\ldots,c_{in}ci1​,ci2​,…,cin​: the cost of each task when it is assigned to theiiith employee.OutputFirst print the minimum total cost.Then printnnnlines each consisting of two integersaaaandbbb: you assign thebbbth task to theaaath employee.If there are multiple solutions you can print any of them.Constraints1≤n≤2001 \le n \le 2001≤n≤2001≤cij≤10001 \le c_{ij} \le 10001≤cij​≤1000ExampleInput:4
