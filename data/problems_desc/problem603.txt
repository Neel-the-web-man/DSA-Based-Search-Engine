Given an array of integersnumscontainingn + 1integers where each integer is in the range[1, n]inclusive.There is onlyone repeated numberinnums, returnthis repeated number.You must solve the problemwithoutmodifying the arraynumsand using only constant extra space.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,3,4,2,2]Output:2Example 2:Input:nums = [3,1,3,4,2]Output:3Example 3:Input:nums = [3,3,3,3,3]Output:3Constraints:1 <= n <= 105nums.length == n + 11 <= nums[i] <= nAll the integers innumsappear onlyonceexcept forprecisely one integerwhich appearstwo or moretimes.Follow up:How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist innums?Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
