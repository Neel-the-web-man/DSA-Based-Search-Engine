Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of sizegroupSize, and consists ofgroupSizeconsecutive cards.Given an integer arrayhandwherehand[i]is the value written on theithcard and an integergroupSize, returntrueif she can rearrange the cards, orfalseotherwise.Example 1:Input:hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3Output:trueExplanation:Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]Example 2:Input:hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4Output:falseExplanation:Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.Constraints:1 <= hand.length <= 1040 <= hand[i] <= 1091 <= groupSize <= hand.lengthNote:This question is the same as 1296:https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/
