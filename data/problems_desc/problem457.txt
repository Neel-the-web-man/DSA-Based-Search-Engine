Given an integer arraynumsand an integerk, return the maximum sum of anon-emptysubsequence of that array such that for every twoconsecutiveintegers in the subsequence,nums[i]andnums[j], wherei < j, the conditionj - i <= kis satisfied.Asubsequenceof an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.Example 1:Input:nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2Output:37Explanation:The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20].Example 2:Input:nums = [-1,-2,-3], k = 1Output:-1Explanation:The subsequence must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number.Example 3:Input:nums = [10,-2,-10,-5,20], k = 2Output:23Explanation:The subsequence is [10, -2, -5, 20].Constraints:1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105-104<= nums[i] <= 104
