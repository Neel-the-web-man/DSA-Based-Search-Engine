Given a non-negative integerx, returnthe square root ofxrounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should benon-negativeas well.Youmust not useany built-in exponent function or operator.For example, do not usepow(x, 0.5)in c++ orx ** 0.5in python.Example 1:Input:x = 4Output:2Explanation:The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.Example 2:Input:x = 8Output:2Explanation:The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.Constraints:0 <= x <= 231- 1
