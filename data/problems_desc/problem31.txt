Given a stringsand a dictionary of stringswordDict, returntrueifscan be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.Notethat the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.Example 1:Input:s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]Output:trueExplanation:Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".Example 2:Input:s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]Output:trueExplanation:Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.Example 3:Input:s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]Output:falseConstraints:1 <= s.length <= 3001 <= wordDict.length <= 10001 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20sandwordDict[i]consist of only lowercase English letters.All the strings ofwordDictareunique.
