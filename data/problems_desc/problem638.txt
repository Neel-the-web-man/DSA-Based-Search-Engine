Given a positive integern, find and returnthelongest distancebetween any twoadjacent1's in the binary representation ofn. If there are no two adjacent1's, return0.Two1's areadjacentif there are only0's separating them (possibly no0's). Thedistancebetween two1's is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two1's in"1001"have a distance of 3.Example 1:Input:n = 22Output:2Explanation:22 in binary is "10110".
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.Example 2:Input:n = 8Output:0Explanation:8 in binary is "1000".
There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.Example 3:Input:n = 5Output:2Explanation:5 in binary is "101".Constraints:1 <= n <= 109
