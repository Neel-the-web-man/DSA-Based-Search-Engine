You are given an array ofnnnpositive integers. Your task is to find two integers such that their greatest common divisor is as large as possible.InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the size of the array.The second line hasnnnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the array.OutputPrint the maximum greatest common divisor.Constraints2≤n≤2⋅1052 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^52≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1061 \le x_i \le 10^61≤xi​≤106ExampleInput:5
