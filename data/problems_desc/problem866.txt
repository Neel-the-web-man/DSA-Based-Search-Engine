Each square of an8×88 \times 88×8chessboard has a robot. Each robot independently moveskkksteps, and there can be many robots on the same square.On each turn, a robot moves one step left, right, up or down, but not outside the board. It randomly chooses a direction among those where it can move.Your task is to calculate the expected number ofemptysquares afterkkkturns.InputThe only input line has an integerkkk.OutputPrint the expected number of empty squares rounded to six decimal places (rounding half to even).Constraints1≤k≤1001 \le k \le 1001≤k≤100ExampleInput:10Output:23.120740
