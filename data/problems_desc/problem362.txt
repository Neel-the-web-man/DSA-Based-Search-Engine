Given ann x nmatrixwhere each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, returnthekthsmallest element in the matrix.Note that it is thekthsmallest elementin the sorted order, not thekthdistinctelement.You must find a solution with a memory complexity better thanO(n2).Example 1:Input:matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8Output:13Explanation:The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8thsmallest number is 13Example 2:Input:matrix = [[-5]], k = 1Output:-5Constraints:n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length1 <= n <= 300-109<= matrix[i][j] <= 109All the rows and columns ofmatrixareguaranteedto be sorted innon-decreasing order.1 <= k <= n2Follow up:Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e.,O(1)memory complexity)?Could you solve the problem inO(n)time complexity? The solution may be too advanced for an interview but you may find readingthis paperfun.
