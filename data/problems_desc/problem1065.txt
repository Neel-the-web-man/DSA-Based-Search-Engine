There is ann×nn \times nn×ngrid, and your task is to choose from each row and column some number of squares. How can you do that?InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the size of the grid. The rows and columns are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.The next line hasnnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\ldots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​: You must choose exactlyaia_iai​squares from theiiith row.The las line hasnnnintegersb1,b2,…,bnb_1,b_2,\ldots,b_nb1​,b2​,…,bn​: You must choose exactlybjb_jbj​squares from thejjjth column.OutputPrintnnnlines describing which squares you choose (Xmeans that you choose a square,.means that you don't choose it). You can print any valid solution.If it is not possible to satisfy the conditions print only−1-1−1.Constraints1≤n≤501 \le n \le 501≤n≤500≤ai≤n0 \le a_i \le n0≤ai​≤n0≤bj≤n0 \le b_j \le n0≤bj​≤nExampleInput:5
