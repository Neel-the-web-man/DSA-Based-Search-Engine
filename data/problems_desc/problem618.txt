TheHamming distancebetween two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.Given an integer arraynums, returnthe sum ofHamming distancesbetween all the pairs of the integers innums.Example 1:Input:nums = [4,14,2]Output:6Explanation:In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case).
The answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.Example 2:Input:nums = [4,14,4]Output:4Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1040 <= nums[i] <= 109The answer for the given input will fit in a32-bitinteger.
