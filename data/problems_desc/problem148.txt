Given an integer arraynums, find asubarraythat has the largest product, and returnthe product.The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a32-bitinteger.Example 1:Input:nums = [2,3,-2,4]Output:6Explanation:[2,3] has the largest product 6.Example 2:Input:nums = [-2,0,-1]Output:0Explanation:The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104-10 <= nums[i] <= 10The product of any subarray ofnumsisguaranteedto fit in a32-bitinteger.
