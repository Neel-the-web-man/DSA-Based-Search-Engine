Given an integer arraynums, returntrueif you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal orfalseotherwise.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,5,11,5]Output:trueExplanation:The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].Example 2:Input:nums = [1,2,3,5]Output:falseExplanation:The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 2001 <= nums[i] <= 100
