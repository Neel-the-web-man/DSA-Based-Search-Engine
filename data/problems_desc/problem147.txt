You are given an array of stringstokensthat represents an arithmetic expression in aReverse Polish Notation.Evaluate the expression. Returnan integer that represents the value of the expression.Notethat:The valid operators are'+','-','*', and'/'.Each operand may be an integer or another expression.The division between two integers alwaystruncates toward zero.There will not be any division by zero.The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a32-bitinteger.Example 1:Input:tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]Output:9Explanation:((2 + 1) * 3) = 9Example 2:Input:tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]Output:6Explanation:(4 + (13 / 5)) = 6Example 3:Input:tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]Output:22Explanation:((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22Constraints:1 <= tokens.length <= 104tokens[i]is either an operator:"+","-","*", or"/", or an integer in the range[-200, 200].
