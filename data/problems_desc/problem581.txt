We havenchips, where the position of theithchip isposition[i].We need to move all the chips tothe same position. In one step, we can change the position of theithchip fromposition[i]to:position[i] + 2orposition[i] - 2withcost = 0.position[i] + 1orposition[i] - 1withcost = 1.Returnthe minimum costneeded to move all the chips to the same position.Example 1:Input:position = [1,2,3]Output:1Explanation:First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
Total cost is 1.Example 2:Input:position = [2,2,2,3,3]Output:2Explanation:We can move the two chips at position  3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.Example 3:Input:position = [1,1000000000]Output:1Constraints:1 <= position.length <= 1001 <= position[i] <= 10^9
