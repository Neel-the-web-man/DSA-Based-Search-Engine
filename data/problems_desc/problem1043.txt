However, you can press each key000–999at mostnnntimes during the process.What is the last number you can write?InputThe only input line contains the value ofnnn.OutputPrint the last number you can write.Constraints1≤n≤10181 \le n \le 10^{18}1≤n≤1018ExampleInput:5Output:12Explanation: You can write the numbers1,2,…,121,2,\ldots,121,2,…,12. This requires that you press key111five times, so you cannot write the number131313.
