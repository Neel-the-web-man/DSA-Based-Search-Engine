Your task is to count the number of one bits in the binary representations of integers between111andnnn.InputThe only input line has an integernnn.OutputPrint the number of one bits in the binary representations of integers between111andnnn.Constraints1≤n≤10151 \le n \le 10^{15}1≤n≤1015ExampleInput:7Output:12Explanation: The binary representations of1…71 \ldots 71…7are 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, and 111, so there are a total of 12 one bits.
