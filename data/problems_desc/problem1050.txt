There is a ball at the top-left corner of ann×mn \times mn×mgrid. The rows of the grid are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n, and the columns are numbered1,2,…,m1,2,\dots,m1,2,…,m.The ball is initially moving diagonally away from the top-left corner. At every step, it moves one cell. Whenever the ball hits the border of the grid, it changes its direction.After how many steps has the ball reached its initial location again? What is the number of distinct cells it has visited?InputThe first line has an integerttt: the number of tests.After this, there aretttlines. Each line has two integersnnn,mmm: the size of the grid.OutputFor each test, print two integers: the number of steps and the number of visited cells.Constraints1≤t≤10001 \le t \le 10001≤t≤10002≤n,m≤1092 \le n,m \le 10^92≤n,m≤109ExampleInput:4
