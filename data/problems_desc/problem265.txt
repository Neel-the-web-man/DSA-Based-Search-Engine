In this problem, a rooted tree is adirectedgraph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree withnnodes (with distinct values from1ton), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from1ton, and was not an edge that already existed.The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array ofedges. Each element ofedgesis a pair[ui, vi]that represents adirectededge connecting nodesuiandvi, whereuiis a parent of childvi.Returnan edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree ofnnodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.Example 1:Input:edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]Output:[2,3]Example 2:Input:edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5]]Output:[4,1]Constraints:n == edges.length3 <= n <= 1000edges[i].length == 21 <= ui, vi<= nui!= vi
