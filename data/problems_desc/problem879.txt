A rotation of a string can be generated by moving characters one after another from beginning to end. For example, the rotations ofacabareacab,caba,abac, andbaca.Your task is to determine the lexicographically minimal rotation of a string.InputThe only input line contains a string of lengthnnn. Each character is one of a–z.OutputPrint the lexicographically minimal rotation.Constraints1≤n≤1061 \le n \le 10^61≤n≤106ExampleInput:acabOutput:abac
