Given two integer arraysarr1andarr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to makearr1strictly increasing.In one operation, you can choose two indices0 <= i < arr1.lengthand0 <= j < arr2.lengthand do the assignmentarr1[i] = arr2[j].If there is no way to makearr1strictly increasing, return-1.Example 1:Input:arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]Output:1Explanation:Replace5with2, thenarr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7].Example 2:Input:arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1]Output:2Explanation:Replace5with3and then replace3with4.arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].Example 3:Input:arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,6,3,3]Output:-1Explanation:You can't makearr1strictly increasing.Constraints:1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 20000 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^9
