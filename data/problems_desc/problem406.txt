Given an arraynumsof integers, returnthe length of the longest arithmetic subsequence innums.Notethat:Asubsequenceis an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.A sequenceseqis arithmetic ifseq[i + 1] - seq[i]are all the same value (for0 <= i < seq.length - 1).Example 1:Input:nums = [3,6,9,12]Output:4Explanation:The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.Example 2:Input:nums = [9,4,7,2,10]Output:3Explanation:The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].Example 3:Input:nums = [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]Output:4Explanation:The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].Constraints:2 <= nums.length <= 10000 <= nums[i] <= 500
