You are given an array ofnnnintegers. You want to modify the array so that it is increasing, i.e., every element is at least as large as the previous element.On each move, you can increase or decrease the value of any element by one. What is the minimum number of moves required?InputThe first input line contains an integernnn: the size of the array.Then, the second line containsnnnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the array.OutputPrint the minimum number of moves.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤109ExampleInput:5
