TheHamming distancebetween two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.Given two integersxandy, returntheHamming distancebetween them.Example 1:Input:x = 1, y = 4Output:2Explanation:1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.Example 2:Input:x = 3, y = 1Output:1Constraints:0 <= x, y <= 231- 1Note:This question is the same as2220: Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number.
