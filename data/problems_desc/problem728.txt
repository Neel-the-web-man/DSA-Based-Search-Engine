You are given an array ofnnnintegers, and your task is to find three values (at distinct positions) whose sum isxxx.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandxxx: the array size and the target sum.The second line hasnnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\dots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​: the array values.OutputPrint three integers: the positions of the values. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, printIMPOSSIBLE.Constraints1≤n≤50001 \le n \le 50001≤n≤50001≤x,ai≤1091 \le x,a_i \le 10^91≤x,ai​≤109ExampleInput:4 8
