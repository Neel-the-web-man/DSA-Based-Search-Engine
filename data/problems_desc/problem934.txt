There arennncities andmmmroutes through which parcels can be carried from one city to another city. For each route, you know the maximum number of parcels and the cost of a single parcel.You want to sendkkkparcels from Syrjälä to Lehmälä. What is the cheapest way to do that?InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmmandkkk: the number of cities, routes and parcels. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n. City111is Syrjälä and citynnnis Lehmälä.After this, there aremmmlines that describe the routes. Each line has four integersaaa,bbb,rrrandccc: there is a route from cityaaato citybbb, at mostrrrparcels can be carried through the route, and the cost of each parcel isccc.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum total cost or−1-1−1if there are no solutions.Constraints2≤n≤5002 \le n \le 5002≤n≤5001≤m≤10001 \le m \le 10001≤m≤10001≤k≤1001 \le k \le 1001≤k≤1001≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤r,c≤10001 \le r,c \le 10001≤r,c≤1000ExampleInput:4 5 3
1 2 5 100
1 3 10 50
1 4 7 500
2 4 8 350
3 4 2 100Output:750Explanation: One parcel is delivered through route1→2→41 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 41→2→4(cost1⋅450=4501 \cdot 450=4501⋅450=450) and two parcels are delivered through route1→3→41 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 41→3→4(cost2⋅150=3002 \cdot 150=3002⋅150=300).
