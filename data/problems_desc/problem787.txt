A game hasnnnrooms andmmmtunnels between them. Each room has a certain number of coins. What is the maximum number of coins you can collect while moving through the tunnels when you can freely choose your starting and ending room?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of rooms and tunnels. The rooms are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Then, there arennnintegersk1,k2,…,knk_1,k_2,\ldots,k_nk1​,k2​,…,kn​: the number of coins in each room.Finally, there aremmmlines describing the tunnels. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is a tunnel from roomaaato roombbb. Each tunnel is a one-way tunnel.OutputPrint one integer: the maximum number of coins you can collect.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤ki≤1091 \le k_i \le 10^91≤ki​≤1091≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:4 4
