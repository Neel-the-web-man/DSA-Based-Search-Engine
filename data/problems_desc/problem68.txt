In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from1to10. The player who first causes the running total toreach or exceed100 wins.What if we change the game so that playerscannotre-use integers?For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.Given two integersmaxChoosableIntegeranddesiredTotal, returntrueif the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, returnfalse. Assume both players playoptimally.Example 1:Input:maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11Output:falseExplanation:No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.Example 2:Input:maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0Output:trueExample 3:Input:maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1Output:trueConstraints:1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 200 <= desiredTotal <= 300
