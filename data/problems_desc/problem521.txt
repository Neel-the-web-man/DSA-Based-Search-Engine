There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer arraypointswherepoints[i] = [xstart, xend]denotes a balloon whosehorizontal diameterstretches betweenxstartandxend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.Arrows can be shot updirectly vertically(in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon withxstartandxendisburstby an arrow shot atxifxstart<= x <= xend. There isno limitto the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.Given the arraypoints, returntheminimumnumber of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.Example 1:Input:points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]Output:2Explanation:The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].Example 2:Input:points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]Output:4Explanation:One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.Example 3:Input:points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]Output:2Explanation:The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].Constraints:1 <= points.length <= 105points[i].length == 2-231<= xstart< xend<= 231- 1
