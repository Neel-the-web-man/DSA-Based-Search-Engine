You are given anm x nbinary matrixgrid.Amoveconsists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all0's to1's, and all1's to0's).Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and thescoreof the matrix is the sum of these numbers.Returnthe highest possiblescoreafter making any number ofmoves(including zero moves).Example 1:Input:grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]Output:39Explanation:0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39Example 2:Input:grid = [[0]]Output:1Constraints:m == grid.lengthn == grid[i].length1 <= m, n <= 20grid[i][j]is either0or1.
