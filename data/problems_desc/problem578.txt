Given an arrayarrof positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:Each node has either0or2children;The values ofarrcorrespond to the values of eachleafin an in-order traversal of the tree.The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree, respectively.Among all possible binary trees considered, returnthe smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node. It is guaranteed this sum fits into a32-bitinteger.A node is aleafif and only if it has zero children.Example 1:Input:arr = [6,2,4]Output:32Explanation:There are two possible trees shown.
The first has a non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.Example 2:Input:arr = [4,11]Output:44Constraints:2 <= arr.length <= 401 <= arr[i] <= 15It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a32-bitsigned integer (i.e., it is less than 231).
