You are given an integer arraynums. You have an integer arrayarrof the same length with all values set to0initially. You also have the followingmodifyfunction:You want to use the modify function to convertarrtonumsusing the minimum number of calls.Returnthe minimum number of function calls to makenumsfromarr.The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a32-bitsigned integer.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,5]Output:5Explanation:Increment by 1 (second element): [0, 0] to get [0, 1] (1 operation).
Double all the elements: [0, 1] -> [0, 2] -> [0, 4] (2 operations).
Increment by 1 (both elements)  [0, 4] -> [1, 4] ->[1, 5](2 operations).
Total of operations: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.Example 2:Input:nums = [2,2]Output:3Explanation:Increment by 1 (both elements) [0, 0] -> [0, 1] -> [1, 1] (2 operations).
Double all the elements: [1, 1] ->[2, 2](1 operation).
Total of operations: 2 + 1 = 3.Example 3:Input:nums = [4,2,5]Output:6Explanation:(initial)[0,0,0] -> [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1] -> [2,0,2] -> [2,1,2] -> [4,2,4] ->[4,2,5](nums).Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1050 <= nums[i] <= 109
