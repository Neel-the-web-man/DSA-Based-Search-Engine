Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that the resulting directed graph is acyclic.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aremmmlines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb.OutputPrintmmmlines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge from nodeaaato nodebbb. You can print any valid solution.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:3 3
