TheFibonacci numbers, commonly denotedF(n)form a sequence, called theFibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from0and1. That is,F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.Givenn, calculateF(n).Example 1:Input:n = 2Output:1Explanation:F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.Example 2:Input:n = 3Output:2Explanation:F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.Example 3:Input:n = 4Output:3Explanation:F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.Constraints:0 <= n <= 30
