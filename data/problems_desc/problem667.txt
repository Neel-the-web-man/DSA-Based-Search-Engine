Given a binary stringsand an integerk, returntrueif every binary code of lengthkis a substring ofs. Otherwise, returnfalse.Example 1:Input:s = "00110110", k = 2Output:trueExplanation:The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.Example 2:Input:s = "0110", k = 1Output:trueExplanation:The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring.Example 3:Input:s = "0110", k = 2Output:falseExplanation:The binary code "00" is of length 2 and does not exist in the array.Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105s[i]is either'0'or'1'.1 <= k <= 20
