Consider an undirected graph that consists ofnnnnodes andmmmedges. There are two types of events that can happen:A new edge is created between nodesaaaandbbb.An existing edge between nodesaaaandbbbis removed.Your task is to report the number of components after every event.InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmmandkkk: the number of nodes, edges and events.After this there aremmmlines describing the edges. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb. There is at most one edge between any pair of nodes.Then there arekkklines describing the events. Each line has the form "tttaaabbb" wheretttis 1 (create a new edge) or 2 (remove an edge). A new edge is always created between two nodes that do not already have an edge between them, and only existing edges can get removed.OutputPrintk+1k+1k+1integers: first the number of components before the first event, and after this the new number of components after each event.Constraints2≤n≤1052 \le n \le 10^52≤n≤1051≤m,k≤1051 \le m,k \le 10^51≤m,k≤1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5 3 3
