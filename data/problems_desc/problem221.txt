TheDNA sequenceis composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as'A','C','G', and'T'.For example,"ACGAATTCCG"is aDNA sequence.When studyingDNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.Given a stringsthat represents aDNA sequence, return all the10-letter-longsequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer inany order.Example 1:Input:s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"Output:["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]Example 2:Input:s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"Output:["AAAAAAAAAA"]Constraints:1 <= s.length <= 105s[i]is either'A','C','G', or'T'.
