Given an arraynumsof sizen, returnthe majority element.The majority element is the element that appears more than⌊n / 2⌋times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.Example 1:Input:nums = [3,2,3]Output:3Example 2:Input:nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]Output:2Constraints:n == nums.length1 <= n <= 5 * 104-109<= nums[i] <= 109Follow-up:Could you solve the problem in linear time and inO(1)space?
