There is a bit string consisting ofnnnbits. Then, there are some changes that invert one given bit. Your task is to report, after each change, the length of the longest substring whose each bit is the same.InputThe first input line has a bit string consisting ofnnnbits. The bits are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n.The next line contains an integermmm: the number of changes.The last line containsmmmintegersx1,x2,…,xmx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_mx1​,x2​,…,xm​describing the changes.OutputAfter each change, print the length of the longest substring whose each bit is the same.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤xi≤n1 \le x_i \le n1≤xi​≤nExampleInput:001011
