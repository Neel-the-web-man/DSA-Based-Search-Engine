Thefrequencyof an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.You are given an integer arraynumsand an integerk. In one operation, you can choose an index ofnumsand increment the element at that index by1.Returnthemaximum possible frequencyof an element after performingat mostkoperations.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,4], k = 5Output:3Explanation:Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
4 has a frequency of 3.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5Output:2Explanation:There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.Example 3:Input:nums = [3,9,6], k = 2Output:1Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1051 <= nums[i] <= 1051 <= k <= 105
