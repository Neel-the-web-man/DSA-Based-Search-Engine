Given an array of integersnumsand an integerk, returnthe number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less thank.Example 1:Input:nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100Output:8Explanation:The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,2,3], k = 0Output:0Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 1041 <= nums[i] <= 10000 <= k <= 106
