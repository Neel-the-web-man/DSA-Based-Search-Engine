You are given a directed graph, and your task is to find out if it contains a negative cycle, and also give an example of such a cycle.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n.After this, the input hasmmmlines describing the edges. Each line has three integersaaa,bbb, andccc: there is an edge from nodeaaato nodebbbwhose length isccc.OutputIf the graph contains a negative cycle, print first "YES", and then the nodes in the cycle in their correct order. If there are several negative cycles, you can print any of them. If there are no negative cycles, print "NO".Constraints1≤n≤25001 \le n \le 25001≤n≤25001≤m≤50001 \le m \le 50001≤m≤50001≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n−109≤c≤109-10^9 \le c \le 10^9−109≤c≤109ExampleInput:4 5
