Given an arraynumscontainingndistinct numbers in the range[0, n], returnthe only number in the range that is missing from the array.Example 1:Input:nums = [3,0,1]Output:2Explanation:n = 3since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range[0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear innums.Example 2:Input:nums = [0,1]Output:2Explanation:n = 2since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range[0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear innums.Example 3:Input:nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]Output:8Explanation:n = 9since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range[0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear innums.Constraints:n == nums.length1 <= n <= 1040 <= nums[i] <= nAll the numbers ofnumsareunique.Follow up:Could you implement a solution using onlyO(1)extra space complexity andO(n)runtime complexity?
