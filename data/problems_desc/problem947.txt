A fence consists ofnnnvertical boards. The width of each board is 1 and their heights may vary.You want to attach a rectangular advertisement to the fence. Your task is to calculate the maximum area of such an advertisement in each window ofkkkvertical boards, from left to right.InputThe first line contains two integersnnnandkkk: the width of the fence and the size of the window.After this, there arennnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1, x_2, \dots, x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the height of each board.OutputPrintn−k+1n - k + 1n−k+1integers: the maximum areas of the advertisements.Constraints1≤k≤n≤2⋅1051 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤k≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤109ExampleInput:8 3
