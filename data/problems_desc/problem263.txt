There arencities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If cityais connected directly with cityb, and citybis connected directly with cityc, then cityais connected indirectly with cityc.Aprovinceis a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.You are given ann x nmatrixisConnectedwhereisConnected[i][j] = 1if theithcity and thejthcity are directly connected, andisConnected[i][j] = 0otherwise.Returnthe total number ofprovinces.Example 1:Input:isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]Output:2Example 2:Input:isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]Output:3Constraints:1 <= n <= 200n == isConnected.lengthn == isConnected[i].lengthisConnected[i][j]is1or0.isConnected[i][i] == 1isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]
