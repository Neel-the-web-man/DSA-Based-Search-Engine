Thek-beautyof an integernumis defined as the number ofsubstringsofnumwhen it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:It has a length ofk.It is a divisor ofnum.Given integersnumandk, returnthe k-beauty ofnum.Note:Leading zerosare allowed.0is not a divisor of any value.Asubstringis a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.Example 1:Input:num = 240, k = 2Output:2Explanation:The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "24" from "240": 24 is a divisor of 240.
- "40" from "240": 40 is a divisor of 240.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.Example 2:Input:num = 430043, k = 2Output:2Explanation:The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
- "30" from "430043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "00" from "430043": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "04" from "430043": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.Constraints:1 <= num <= 1091 <= k <= num.length(takingnumas a string)
