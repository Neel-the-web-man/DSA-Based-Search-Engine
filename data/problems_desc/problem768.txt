There arennncities andmmmflight connections between them. Your task is to determine the length of the shortest route from Syrjälä to every city.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of cities and flight connections. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n, and city111is Syrjälä.After that, there aremmmlines describing the flight connections. Each line has three integersaaa,bbbandccc: a flight begins at cityaaa, ends at citybbb, and its length isccc. Each flight is a one-way flight.You can assume that it is possible to travel from Syrjälä to all other cities.OutputPrintnnnintegers: the shortest route lengths from Syrjälä to cities1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤c≤1091 \le c \le 10^91≤c≤109ExampleInput:3 4
