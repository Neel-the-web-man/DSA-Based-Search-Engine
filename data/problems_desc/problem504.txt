You are given an integer arraynums. You are initially positioned at the array'sfirst index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.Returntrueif you can reach the last index, orfalseotherwise.Example 1:Input:nums = [2,3,1,1,4]Output:trueExplanation:Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.Example 2:Input:nums = [3,2,1,0,4]Output:falseExplanation:You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1040 <= nums[i] <= 105
