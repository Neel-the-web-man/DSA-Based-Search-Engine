You are given an array consisting ofnnndistinct integers. On each move, you can swap any two adjacent values.You want to transform the array into apyramid array. This means that the final array has to be first increasing and then decreasing. It is also allowed that the final array is only increasing or decreasing.What is the minimum number of moves needed?InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the size of the array.The next line hasnnndistinct integersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\dots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the array.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum number of moves.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤109ExampleInput:4
2 1 5 3Output:1Explanation: You may swap the first two values which creates a pyramid array[1,2,5,3][1,2,5,3][1,2,5,3].
