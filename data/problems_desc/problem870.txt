There arennnheaps of sticks and two players who move alternately. On each move, a player chooses a non-empty heap and removes any number of sticks. The player who removes the last stick wins the game.Your task is to find out who wins if both players play optimally.InputThe first input line contains an integerttt: the number of tests. After this,ttttest cases are described:The first line contains an integernnn: the number of heaps.The next line hasnnnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\ldots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the number of sticks in each heap.OutputFor each test case, print "first" if the first player wins the game and "second" if the second player wins the game.Constraints1≤t≤2⋅1051 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤t≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤109the sum of allnnnis at most2⋅1052 \cdot 10^52⋅105ExampleInput:3
