A teacher is writing a test withntrue/false questions, with'T'denoting true and'F'denoting false. He wants to confuse the students bymaximizingthe number ofconsecutivequestions with thesameanswer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).You are given a stringanswerKey, whereanswerKey[i]is the original answer to theithquestion. In addition, you are given an integerk, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:Change the answer key for any question to'T'or'F'(i.e., setanswerKey[i]to'T'or'F').Returnthemaximumnumber of consecutive'T's or'F'sin the answer key after performing the operation at mostktimes.Example 1:Input:answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2Output:4Explanation:We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = "TTTT".
There are four consecutive 'T's.Example 2:Input:answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1Output:3Explanation:We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "FFFT".
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "TFFF".
In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.Example 3:Input:answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1Output:5Explanation:We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = "TTTTTFTT"
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTFTTTTT". 
In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.Constraints:n == answerKey.length1 <= n <= 5 * 104answerKey[i]is either'T'or'F'1 <= k <= n
