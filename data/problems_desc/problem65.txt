Given an array of intervalsintervalswhereintervals[i] = [starti, endi], returnthe minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.Notethat intervals which only touch at a point arenon-overlapping. For example,[1, 2]and[2, 3]are non-overlapping.Example 1:Input:intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]Output:1Explanation:[1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.Example 2:Input:intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]Output:2Explanation:You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.Example 3:Input:intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]Output:0Explanation:You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.Constraints:1 <= intervals.length <= 105intervals[i].length == 2-5 * 104<= starti< endi<= 5 * 104
