Given a polygon, your task is to calculate the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary. A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are integers.The polygon consists ofnnnvertices(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn)(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n)(x1​,y1​),(x2​,y2​),…,(xn​,yn​). The vertices(xi,yi)(x_i,y_i)(xi​,yi​)and(xi+1,yi+1)(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})(xi+1​,yi+1​)are adjacent fori=1,2,…,n−1i=1,2,\dots,n-1i=1,2,…,n−1, and the vertices(x1,y1)(x_1,y_1)(x1​,y1​)and(xn,yn)(x_n,y_n)(xn​,yn​)are also adjacent.InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the number of vertices.After this, there arennnlines that describe the vertices. Theiiith such line has two integersxix_ixi​andyiy_iyi​.You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself.OutputPrint two integers: the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary.Constraints3≤n≤1053 \le n \le 10^53≤n≤105−109≤xi,yi≤109-10^9 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9−109≤xi​,yi​≤109ExampleInput:4
