There is an undirected connected tree withnnodes labeled from0ton - 1andn - 1edges.You are given the integernand the arrayedgeswhereedges[i] = [ai, bi]indicates that there is an edge between nodesaiandbiin the tree.Return an arrayanswerof lengthnwhereanswer[i]is the sum of the distances between theithnode in the tree and all other nodes.Example 1:Input:n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]Output:[8,12,6,10,10,10]Explanation:The tree is shown above.
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.Example 2:Input:n = 1, edges = []Output:[0]Example 3:Input:n = 2, edges = [[1,0]]Output:[1,1]Constraints:1 <= n <= 3 * 104edges.length == n - 1edges[i].length == 20 <= ai, bi< nai!= biThe given input represents a valid tree.
