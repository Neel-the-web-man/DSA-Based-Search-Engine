Winston was given the above mysterious functionfunc. He has an integer arrayarrand an integertargetand he wants to find the valueslandrthat make the value|func(arr, l, r) - target|minimum possible.Returnthe minimum possible valueof|func(arr, l, r) - target|.Notice thatfuncshould be called with the valueslandrwhere0 <= l, r < arr.length.Example 1:Input:arr = [9,12,3,7,15], target = 5Output:2Explanation:Calling func with all the pairs of [l,r] = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4],[0,3],[1,4],[0,4]], Winston got the following results [9,12,3,7,15,8,0,3,7,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The value closest to 5 is 7 and 3, thus the minimum difference is 2.Example 2:Input:arr = [1000000,1000000,1000000], target = 1Output:999999Explanation:Winston called the func with all possible values of [l,r] and he always got 1000000, thus the min difference is 999999.Example 3:Input:arr = [1,2,4,8,16], target = 0Output:0Constraints:1 <= arr.length <= 1051 <= arr[i] <= 1060 <= target <= 107
