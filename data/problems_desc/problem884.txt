Given a string and patterns, check for each pattern if it appears in the string.InputThe first input line has a string of lengthnnn.The next input line has an integerkkk: the number of patterns. Finally, there arekkklines that describe the patterns.The string and the patterns consist of characters a–z.OutputFor each pattern, print "YES" if it appears in the string and "NO" otherwise.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤k≤5⋅1051 \le k \le 5 \cdot 10^51≤k≤5⋅105the total length of the patterns is at most5⋅1055 \cdot 10^55⋅105ExampleInput:aybabtu
