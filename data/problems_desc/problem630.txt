You are given ann x nbinary gridboard. In each move, you can swap any two rows with each other, or any two columns with each other.Returnthe minimum number of moves to transform the board into achessboard board. If the task is impossible, return-1.Achessboard boardis a board where no0's and no1's are 4-directionally adjacent.Example 1:Input:board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]Output:2Explanation:One potential sequence of moves is shown.
The first move swaps the first and second column.
The second move swaps the second and third row.Example 2:Input:board = [[0,1],[1,0]]Output:0Explanation:Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner, is also a valid chessboard.Example 3:Input:board = [[1,0],[1,0]]Output:-1Explanation:No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.Constraints:n == board.lengthn == board[i].length2 <= n <= 30board[i][j]is either0or1.
