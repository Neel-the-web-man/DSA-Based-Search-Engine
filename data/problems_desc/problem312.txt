There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integernwhich denotes that the graph hasnnodes labeled from1ton, and an arrayedgeswhere eachedges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]denotes that there is an edge between nodesuiandviwith weight equal toweighti.A path from nodestartto nodeendis a sequence of nodes[z0, z1,z2, ..., zk]such thatz0= startandzk= endand there is an edge betweenziandzi+1where0 <= i <= k-1.The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. LetdistanceToLastNode(x)denote the shortest distance of a path between nodenand nodex. Arestricted pathis a path that also satisfies thatdistanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1)where0 <= i <= k-1.Returnthe number of restricted paths from node1to noden. Since that number may be too large, return itmodulo109+ 7.Example 1:Input:n = 5, edges = [[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[2,3,1],[1,4,2],[5,2,2],[3,5,1],[5,4,10]]Output:3Explanation:Each circle contains the node number in black and itsdistanceToLastNode value in blue.The three restricted paths are:
1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
3) 1 --> 3 --> 5Example 2:Input:n = 7, edges = [[1,3,1],[4,1,2],[7,3,4],[2,5,3],[5,6,1],[6,7,2],[7,5,3],[2,6,4]]Output:1Explanation:Each circle contains the node number in black and itsdistanceToLastNode value in blue.The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.Constraints:1 <= n <= 2 * 104n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4 * 104edges[i].length == 31 <= ui, vi<= nui!= vi1 <= weighti<= 105There is at most one edge between any two nodes.There is at least one path between any two nodes.
