Your task is to create a permutation of numbers1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,nwhose longest monotone subsequence has exactlykkkelements.A monotone subsequence is either increasing or decreasing. For example, some monotone subsequences in[2,1,4,5,3][2,1,4,5,3][2,1,4,5,3]are[2,4,5][2,4,5][2,4,5]and[4,3][4,3][4,3].InputThe first input line has an integerttt: the number of tests.After this, there aretttlines. Each line has two integersnnnandkkk.OutputFor each test, print a line that contains the permutation. You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, printIMPOSSIBLE.Constraints1≤t≤10001 \le t \le 10001≤t≤10001≤k≤n≤1001 \le k \le n \le 1001≤k≤n≤100ExampleInput:3
