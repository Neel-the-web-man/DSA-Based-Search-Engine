You are given an array of variable pairsequationsand an array of real numbersvalues, whereequations[i] = [Ai, Bi]andvalues[i]represent the equationAi/ Bi= values[i]. EachAiorBiis a string that represents a single variable.You are also given somequeries, wherequeries[j] = [Cj, Dj]represents thejthquery where you must find the answer forCj/ Dj= ?.Returnthe answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return-1.0.Note:The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.Note:The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.Example 1:Input:equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]Output:[6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]Explanation:Given:a / b = 2.0,b / c = 3.0queries are:a / c = ?,b / a = ?,a / e = ?,a / a = ?,x / x = ?return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
note: x is undefined => -1.0Example 2:Input:equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]Output:[3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]Example 3:Input:equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]Output:[0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]Constraints:1 <= equations.length <= 20equations[i].length == 21 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5values.length == equations.length0.0 < values[i] <= 20.01 <= queries.length <= 20queries[i].length == 21 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5Ai, Bi, Cj, Djconsist of lower case English letters and digits.
