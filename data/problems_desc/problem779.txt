You are playing a game consisting ofnnnplanets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself).Your task is to processqqqqueries of the form: when you begin on planetxxxand travel throughkkkteleporters, which planet will you reach?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandqqq: the number of planets and queries. The planets are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.The second line hasnnnintegerst1,t2,…,tnt_1,t_2,\dots,t_nt1​,t2​,…,tn​: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter. It is possible thatti=it_i=iti​=i.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. Each line has two integersxxxandkkk: you start on planetxxxand travel throughkkkteleporters.OutputPrint the answer to each query.Constraints1≤n,q≤2⋅1051 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,q≤2⋅1051≤ti≤n1 \le t_i \le n1≤ti​≤n1≤x≤n1 \le x \le n1≤x≤n0≤k≤1090 \le k \le 10^90≤k≤109ExampleInput:4 3
