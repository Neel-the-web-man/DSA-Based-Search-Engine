You are given a string s of lengthncontaining only four kinds of characters:'Q','W','E', and'R'.A string is said to bebalancedif each of its characters appearsn / 4times wherenis the length of the string.Returnthe minimum length of the substring that can be replaced withanyother string of the same length to makesbalanced. If s is alreadybalanced, return0.Example 1:Input:s = "QWER"Output:0Explanation:s is already balanced.Example 2:Input:s = "QQWE"Output:1Explanation:We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.Example 3:Input:s = "QQQW"Output:2Explanation:We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER".Constraints:n == s.length4 <= n <= 105nis a multiple of4.scontains only'Q','W','E', and'R'.
