You are given severalboxeswith different colors represented by different positive numbers.You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (i.e., composed ofkboxes,k >= 1), remove them and getk * kpoints.Returnthe maximum points you can get.Example 1:Input:boxes = [1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]Output:23Explanation:[1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points) 
----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [] (2*2=4 points)Example 2:Input:boxes = [1,1,1]Output:9Example 3:Input:boxes = [1]Output:1Constraints:1 <= boxes.length <= 1001 <= boxes[i]Â <= 100
