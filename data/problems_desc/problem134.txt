Given an integerrowIndex, return therowIndexth(0-indexed) row of thePascal's triangle.InPascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:Example 1:Input:rowIndex = 3Output:[1,3,3,1]Example 2:Input:rowIndex = 0Output:[1]Example 3:Input:rowIndex = 1Output:[1,1]Constraints:0 <= rowIndex <= 33Follow up:Could you optimize your algorithm to use onlyO(rowIndex)extra space?
