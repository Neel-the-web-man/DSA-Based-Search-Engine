There arennnchildren around a round table. For each child, you know the amount of food they currently have and the amount of food they want. The total amount of food in the table is correct.At each step, a child can give one unit of food to his or her neighbour. What is the minimum number of steps needed?InputThe first input line contains an integernnn: the number of children.The next line hasnnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\ldots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​: the current amount of food for each child.The last line hasnnnintegersb1,b2,…,bnb_1,b_2,\ldots,b_nb1​,b2​,…,bn​: the required amount of food for each child.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum number of steps.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1050≤ai,bi≤1060 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^60≤ai​,bi​≤106ExampleInput:3
