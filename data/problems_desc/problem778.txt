You are going to travel from Syrjälä to Lehmälä by plane. You would like to find answers to the following questions:what is the minimum price of such a route?how many minimum-price routes are there? (modulo109+7)10^9+7)109+7)what is the minimum number of flights in a minimum-price route?what is the maximum number of flights in a minimum-price route?InputThe first input line contains two integersnnnandmmm: the number of cities and the number of flights. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n. City 1 is Syrjälä, and citynnnis Lehmälä.After this, there aremmmlines describing the flights. Each line has three integersaaa,bbb, andccc: there is a flight from cityaaato citybbbwith priceccc. All flights are one-way flights.You may assume that there is a route from Syrjälä to Lehmälä.OutputPrint four integers according to the problem statement.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤c≤1091 \le c \le 10^91≤c≤109ExampleInput:4 5
