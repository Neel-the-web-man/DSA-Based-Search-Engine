You are given an arraypriceswhereprices[i]is the price of a given stock on theithday, and an integerfeerepresenting a transaction fee.Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.Note:You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.Example 1:Input:prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2Output:8Explanation:The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.Example 2:Input:prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3Output:6Constraints:1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 1041 <= prices[i] < 5 * 1040 <= fee < 5 * 104
