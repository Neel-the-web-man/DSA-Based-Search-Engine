Given an integer arraynumsand an integerk, splitnumsintoknon-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray isminimized.Returnthe minimized largest sum of the split.Asubarrayis a contiguous part of the array.Example 1:Input:nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2Output:18Explanation:There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2Output:9Explanation:There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 10000 <= nums[i] <= 1061 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)
