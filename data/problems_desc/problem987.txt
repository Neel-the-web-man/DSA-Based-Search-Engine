You are given a tree withnnnnodes. Some nodes contain a coin.Your task is to answerqqqqueries of the form: what is the shortest length of a path from nodeaaato nodebbbthat visits a node with a coin?InputThe first line contains two integersnnnandqqq: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1, 2, \dots, n1,2,…,n.The second line containsnnnintegersc1,c2,…,cnc_1, c_2,\dots, c_nc1​,c2​,…,cn​. Ifci=1c_i = 1ci​=1, nodeiiihas a coin. Ifci=0c_i = 0ci​=0, nodeiiidoesn't have a coin. You can assume at least one node has a coin.Then there aren−1n-1n−1lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. Each line contains two integersaaaandbbb: the start and end nodes.OutputPrintqqqintegers: the answers to the queries.Constraints1≤n,q≤2⋅1051 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,q≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a, b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5 4
