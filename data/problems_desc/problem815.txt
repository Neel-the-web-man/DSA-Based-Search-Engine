You are given an array that consists ofnnnintegers. The array elements are indexed1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.You can modify the array using the following operation: choose an array element and increase its value by one.Your task is to processqqqqueries of the form: when we consider a subarray from positionaaato positionbbb, what is the minimum number of operations after which the subarray is increasing?An array is increasing if each element is greater than or equal with the previous element.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandqqq: the size of the array and the number of queries.The next line hasnnnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\dots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the contents of the array.Finally, there areqqqlines that describe the queries. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: the starting and ending position of a subarray.OutputFor each query, print the minimum number of operations.Constraints1≤n,q≤2⋅1051 \le n,q \le 2\cdot10^51≤n,q≤2⋅1051≤xi≤1091 \le x_i \le 10^91≤xi​≤1091≤a≤b≤n1 \le a \le b \le n1≤a≤b≤nExampleInput:5 3
