You are given ann×nn \times nn×ngrid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or contains a tree. The upper-left square has coordinates(1,1)(1,1)(1,1), and the lower-right square has coordinates(n,n)(n,n)(n,n).Your task is to processqqqqueries of the form: how many trees are inside a given rectangle in the forest?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandqqq: the size of the forest and the number of queries.Then, there arennnlines describing the forest. Each line hasnnncharacters:.is an empty square and*is a tree.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. Each line has four integersy1y_1y1​,x1x_1x1​,y2y_2y2​,x2x_2x2​corresponding to the corners of a rectangle.OutputPrint the number of trees inside each rectangle.Constraints1≤n≤10001 \le n \le 10001≤n≤10001≤q≤2⋅1051 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤q≤2⋅1051≤y1≤y2≤n1 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le n1≤y1​≤y2​≤n1≤x1≤x2≤n1 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le n1≤x1​≤x2​≤nExampleInput:4 3
