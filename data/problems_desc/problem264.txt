In this problem, a tree is anundirected graphthat is connected and has no cycles.You are given a graph that started as a tree withnnodes labeled from1ton, with one additional edge added. The added edge has twodifferentvertices chosen from1ton, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an arrayedgesof lengthnwhereedges[i] = [ai, bi]indicates that there is an edge between nodesaiandbiin the graph.Returnan edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree ofnnodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.Example 1:Input:edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]Output:[2,3]Example 2:Input:edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]Output:[1,4]Constraints:n == edges.length3 <= n <= 1000edges[i].length == 21 <= ai< bi<= edges.lengthai!= biThere are no repeated edges.The given graph is connected.
