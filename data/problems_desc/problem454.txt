Given an array of integersarrand two integerskandthreshold, returnthe number of sub-arrays of sizekand average greater than or equal tothreshold.Example 1:Input:arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4Output:3Explanation:Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).Example 2:Input:arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5Output:6Explanation:The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.Constraints:1 <= arr.length <= 1051 <= arr[i] <= 1041 <= k <= arr.length0 <= threshold <= 104
