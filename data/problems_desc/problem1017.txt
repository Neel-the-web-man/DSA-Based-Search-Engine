You are given an array that contains each number between1…n1 \dots n1…nexactly once. You collect the numbers in increasing order from111tonnn. On each round, you traverse the array from left to right and collect as many consecutive numbers as possible, starting from the smallest number that has not been collected yet.Your task is to determine, for eachk=1,2,…,nk=1,2,\dots,nk=1,2,…,n, the number of arrays that require exactlykkkrounds to collect all the numbers.InputThe only line has an integernnn.OutputPrintnnnnumbers: for eachk=1,2,…,nk=1,2,\dots,nk=1,2,…,n, the answer modulo109+710^9+7109+7.Constraints1≤n≤50001 \le n \le 50001≤n≤5000ExampleInput:3Output:1

1Explanation: The arrays are[1,2,3][1,2,3][1,2,3](111round),[1,3,2][1,3,2][1,3,2](222rounds),[2,1,3][2,1,3][2,1,3](222rounds),[2,3,1][2,3,1][2,3,1](222rounds),[3,1,2][3,1,2][3,1,2](222rounds), and[3,2,1][3,2,1][3,2,1](333rounds).
