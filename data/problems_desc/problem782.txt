There arennncities andmmmroads between them. Unfortunately, the condition of the roads is so poor that they cannot be used. Your task is to repair some of the roads so that there will be a decent route between any two cities.For each road, you know its reparation cost, and you should find a solution where the total cost is as small as possible.InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Then, there aremmmlines describing the roads. Each line has three integersaaa,bbbandccc: there is a road between citiesaaaandbbb, and its reparation cost isccc. All roads are two-way roads.Every road is between two different cities, and there is at most one road between two cities.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum total reparation cost. However, if there are no solutions, print "IMPOSSIBLE".Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤c≤1091 \le c \le 10^91≤c≤109ExampleInput:5 6
