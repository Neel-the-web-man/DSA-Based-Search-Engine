Your task is to find thekkkshortest flight routes from Syrjälä to Metsälä. A route can visit the same city several times.Note that there can be several routes with the same price and each of them should be considered (see the example).InputThe first input line has three integersnnn,mmm, andkkk: the number of cities, the number of flights, and the parameterkkk. The cities are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n. City 1 is Syrjälä, and citynnnis Metsälä.After this, the input hasmmmlines describing the flights. Each line has three integersaaa,bbb, andccc: a flight begins at cityaaa, ends at citybbb, and its price isccc. All flights are one-way flights.You may assume that there are at leastkkkdistinct routes from Syrjälä to Metsälä.OutputPrintkkkintegers: the prices of thekkkcheapest routes sorted according to their prices.Constraints2≤n≤1052 \le n \le 10^52≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤c≤1091 \le c \le 10^91≤c≤1091≤k≤101 \le k \le 101≤k≤10ExampleInput:4 6 3
