There is an undirectedstargraph consisting ofnnodes labeled from1ton. A star graph is a graph where there is onecenternode andexactlyn - 1edges that connect the center node with every other node.You are given a 2D integer arrayedgeswhere eachedges[i] = [ui, vi]indicates that there is an edge between the nodesuiandvi. Return the center of the given star graph.Example 1:Input:edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]Output:2Explanation:As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.Example 2:Input:edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]Output:1Constraints:3 <= n <= 105edges.length == n - 1edges[i].length == 21 <= ui,vi<= nui!= viThe givenedgesrepresent a valid star graph.
