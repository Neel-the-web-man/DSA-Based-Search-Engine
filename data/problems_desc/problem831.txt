You are given a rooted tree consisting ofnnnnodes. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n, and node111is the root. Each node has a value.Your task is to process following types of queries:change the value of nodessstoxxxcalculate the sum of values in the subtree of nodesssInputThe first input line contains two integersnnnandqqq: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\ldots,n1,2,…,n.The next line hasnnnintegersv1,v2,…,vnv_1,v_2,\ldots,v_nv1​,v2​,…,vn​: the value of each node.Then there aren−1n-1n−1lines describing the edges. Each line contans two integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge between nodesaaaandbbb.Finally, there areqqqlines describing the queries. Each query is either of the form "1sssxxx" or "2sss".OutputPrint the answer to each query of type 2.Constraints1≤n,q≤2⋅1051 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n,q≤2⋅1051≤a,b,s≤n1 \le a,b, s \le n1≤a,b,s≤n1≤vi,x≤1091 \le v_i, x \le 10^91≤vi​,x≤109ExampleInput:5 3
