Given 3 positives numbersa,bandc. Return the minimum flips required in some bits ofaandbto make (aORb==c). (bitwise OR operation).Flip operation consists of changeanysingle bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.Example 1:Input:a = 2, b = 6, c = 5Output:3Explanation:After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (aORb==c)Example 2:Input:a = 4, b = 2, c = 7Output:1Example 3:Input:a = 1, b = 2, c = 3Output:0Constraints:1 <= a <= 10^91 <= b <= 10^91 <= c <= 10^9
