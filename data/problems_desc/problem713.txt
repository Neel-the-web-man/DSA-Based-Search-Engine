You are given an array that contains each number between1…n1 \dots n1…nexactly once. Your task is to collect the numbers from111tonnnin increasing order.On each round, you go through the array from left to right and collect as many numbers as possible. What will be the total number of rounds?InputThe first line has an integernnn: the array size.The next line hasnnnintegersx1,x2,…,xnx_1,x_2,\dots,x_nx1​,x2​,…,xn​: the numbers in the array.OutputPrint one integer: the number of rounds.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅105ExampleInput:5
