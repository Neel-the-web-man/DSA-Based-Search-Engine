Balancedstrings are those that have an equal quantity of'L'and'R'characters.Given abalancedstrings, split it into some number of substrings such that:Each substring is balanced.Returnthemaximumnumber of balanced strings you can obtain.Example 1:Input:s = "RLRRLLRLRL"Output:4Explanation:s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.Example 2:Input:s = "RLRRRLLRLL"Output:2Explanation:s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2ndand 5thsubstrings are not balanced.Example 3:Input:s = "LLLLRRRR"Output:1Explanation:s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".Constraints:2 <= s.length <= 1000s[i]is either'L'or'R'.sis abalancedstring.
