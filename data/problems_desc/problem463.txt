You are given an arraypoints, an integerangle, and yourlocation, wherelocation = [posx, posy]andpoints[i] = [xi, yi]both denoteintegral coordinateson the X-Y plane.Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. Youcannot movefrom your position, but you canrotate. In other words,posxandposycannot be changed. Your field of view indegreesis represented byangle, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Letdbe the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is theinclusiverange of angles[d - angle/2, d + angle/2].Your browser does not support the video tag or this video format.You canseesome set of points if, for each point, theangleformed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position isin your field of view.There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.Returnthe maximum number of points you can see.Example 1:Input:points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]Output:3Explanation:The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is in front and in the same line of sight.Example 2:Input:points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]Output:4Explanation:All points can be made visible in your field of view, including the one at your location.Example 3:Input:points = [[1,0],[2,1]], angle = 13, location = [1,1]Output:1Explanation:You can only see one of the two points, as shown above.Constraints:1 <= points.length <= 105points[i].length == 2location.length == 20 <= angle < 3600 <= posx, posy, xi, yi<= 100
