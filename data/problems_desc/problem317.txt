There is abi-directionalgraph withnvertices, where each vertex is labeled from0ton - 1(inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer arrayedges, where eachedges[i] = [ui, vi]denotes a bi-directional edge between vertexuiand vertexvi. Every vertex pair is connected byat most oneedge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.You want to determine if there is avalid paththat exists from vertexsourceto vertexdestination.Givenedgesand the integersn,source, anddestination, returntrueif there is avalid pathfromsourcetodestination, orfalseotherwise.Example 1:Input:n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2Output:trueExplanation:There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
- 0 → 1 → 2
- 0 → 2Example 2:Input:n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5Output:falseExplanation:There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.Constraints:1 <= n <= 2 * 1050 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105edges[i].length == 20 <= ui, vi<= n - 1ui!= vi0 <= source, destination <= n - 1There are no duplicate edges.There are no self edges.
