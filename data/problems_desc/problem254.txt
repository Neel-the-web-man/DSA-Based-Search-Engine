Given string num representing a non-negative integernum, and an integerk, returnthe smallest possible integer after removingkdigits fromnum.Example 1:Input:num = "1432219", k = 3Output:"1219"Explanation:Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.Example 2:Input:num = "10200", k = 1Output:"200"Explanation:Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.Example 3:Input:num = "10", k = 2Output:"0"Explanation:Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.Constraints:1 <= k <= num.length <= 105numconsists of only digits.numdoes not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
