There arennnsticks with some lengths. Your task is to modify the sticks so that each stick has the same length.You can either lengthen and shorten each stick. Both operations costxxxwherexxxis the difference between the new and original length.What is the minimum total cost?InputThe first input line contains an integernnn: the number of sticks.Then there arennnintegers:p1,p2,…,pnp_1,p_2,\ldots,p_np1​,p2​,…,pn​: the lengths of the sticks.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum total cost.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤pi≤1091 \le p_i \le 10^91≤pi​≤109ExampleInput:5
