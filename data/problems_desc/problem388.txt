You are standing at position0on an infinite number line. There is a destination at positiontarget.You can make some number of movesnumMovesso that:On each move, you can either go left or right.During theithmove (starting fromi == 1toi == numMoves), you takeisteps in the chosen direction.Given the integertarget, returntheminimumnumber of moves required (i.e., the minimumnumMoves) to reach the destination.Example 1:Input:target = 2Output:3Explanation:On the 1stmove, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2ndmove, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rdmove, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).Example 2:Input:target = 3Output:2Explanation:On the 1stmove, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2ndmove, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).Constraints:-109<= target <= 109target != 0
