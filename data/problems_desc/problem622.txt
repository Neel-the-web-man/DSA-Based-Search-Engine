You have a set of integerss, which originally contains all the numbers from1ton. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers insgot duplicated to another number in the set, which results inrepetition of onenumber andloss of anothernumber.You are given an integer arraynumsrepresenting the data status of this set after the error.Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and returnthem in the form of an array.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,2,4]Output:[2,3]Example 2:Input:nums = [1,1]Output:[1,2]Constraints:2 <= nums.length <= 1041 <= nums[i] <= 104
