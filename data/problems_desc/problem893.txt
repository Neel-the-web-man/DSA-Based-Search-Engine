You are given a string of lengthnnn. If all of its distinct substrings are ordered lexicographically, what is thekkkth smallest of them?InputThe first input line has a string of lengthnnnthat consists of characters a–z.The second input line has an integerkkk.OutputPrint thekkkth smallest distinct substring in lexicographical order.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤k≤n(n+1)21 \le k \le \frac{n(n+1)}{2}1≤k≤2n(n+1)​It is guaranteed thatkkkdoes not exceed the number of distinct substrings.ExampleInput:babaacbaab
10Output:abaExplanation: The 10 smallest distinct substrings in order are a, aa, aab, aac, aacb, aacba, aacbaa, aacbaab, ab, and aba.
