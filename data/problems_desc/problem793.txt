Consider a network consisting ofnnncomputers andmmmconnections. Each connection specifies how fast a computer can send data to another computer.Kotivalo wants to download some data from a server. What is the maximum speed he can do this, using the connections in the network?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of computers and connections. The computers are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n. Computer111is the server and computernnnis Kotivalo's computer.After this, there aremmmlines describing the connections. Each line has three integersaaa,bbbandccc: computeraaacan send data to computerbbbat speedccc.OutputPrint one integer: the maximum speed Kotivalo can download data.Constraints1≤n≤5001 \le n \le 5001≤n≤5001≤m≤10001 \le m \le 10001≤m≤10001≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤n1≤c≤1091 \le c \le 10^91≤c≤109ExampleInput:4 5
