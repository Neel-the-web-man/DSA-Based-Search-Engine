You are given two arrays ofnnnintegers.Your task is to select a nonempty prefix from both arrays such that the average of all selected numbers is as large as possible.InputThe first line has an integernnn.The second line hasnnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana_1,a_2,\dots,a_na1​,a2​,…,an​: the numbers in the first array.The third line hasnnnintegersb1,b2,…,bnb_1,b_2,\dots,b_nb1​,b2​,…,bn​: the numbers in the second array.OutputPrint two numbers: the prefix sizes.Your answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative difference to the maximum average is at most10−610^{-6}10−6.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤ai,bi≤1091 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^91≤ai​,bi​≤109ExampleInput:4
1 5 5 2
3 1 3 1Output:3 1Explanation: if you choose the prefixes[1,5,5][1,5,5][1,5,5]and[3][3][3], the average is(1+5+5+3)/4=3.5(1+5+5+3)/4=3.5(1+5+5+3)/4=3.5which is the maximum possible average.
