Given two stringssandt, returntrueifsis asubsequenceoft, orfalseotherwise.Asubsequenceof a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e.,"ace"is a subsequence of"abcde"while"aec"is not).Example 1:Input:s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"Output:trueExample 2:Input:s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"Output:falseConstraints:0 <= s.length <= 1000 <= t.length <= 104sandtconsist only of lowercase English letters.Follow up:Suppose there are lots of incomings, says1, s2, ..., skwherek >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see ifthas its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
