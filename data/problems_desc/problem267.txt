There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence ofndigits where each digit can be in the range[0, k - 1].The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks themost recentndigitsthat were entered each time you type a digit.For example, the correct password is"345"and you enter in"012345":After typing0, the most recent3digits is"0", which is incorrect.After typing1, the most recent3digits is"01", which is incorrect.After typing2, the most recent3digits is"012", which is incorrect.After typing3, the most recent3digits is"123", which is incorrect.After typing4, the most recent3digits is"234", which is incorrect.After typing5, the most recent3digits is"345", which is correct and the safe unlocks.Returnany string ofminimum lengththat will unlock the safeat some pointof entering it.Example 1:Input:n = 1, k = 2Output:"10"Explanation:The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. "01" would also unlock the safe.Example 2:Input:n = 2, k = 2Output:"01100"Explanation:For each possible password:
- "00" is typed in starting from the 4thdigit.
- "01" is typed in starting from the 1stdigit.
- "10" is typed in starting from the 3rddigit.
- "11" is typed in starting from the 2nddigit.
Thus "01100" will unlock the safe. "10011", and "11001" would also unlock the safe.Constraints:1 <= n <= 41 <= k <= 101 <= kn<= 4096
