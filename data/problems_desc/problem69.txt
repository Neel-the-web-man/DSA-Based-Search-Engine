We definestr = [s, n]as the stringstrwhich consists of the stringsconcatenatedntimes.For example,str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc".We define that strings1can be obtained from strings2if we can remove some characters froms2such that it becomess1.For example,s1 = "abc"can be obtained froms2 = "abdbec"based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.You are given two stringss1ands2and two integersn1andn2. You have the two stringsstr1 = [s1, n1]andstr2 = [s2, n2].Returnthe maximum integermsuch thatstr = [str2, m]can be obtained fromstr1.Example 1:Input:s1 = "acb", n1 = 4, s2 = "ab", n2 = 2Output:2Example 2:Input:s1 = "acb", n1 = 1, s2 = "acb", n2 = 1Output:1Constraints:1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100s1ands2consist of lowercase English letters.1 <= n1, n2 <= 106
