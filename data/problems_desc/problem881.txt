Given a string, calculate for each position the length of the longest palindrome that ends at that position.InputThe only line contains a string of lengthnnn. Each character is one of a–z.OutputPrintnnnnumbers: the length of each palindrome.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅105ExampleInput:ababbababaaOutput:1 1 3 3 2 4 6 8 5 5 2
