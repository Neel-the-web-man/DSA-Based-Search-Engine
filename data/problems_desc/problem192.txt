Given two non-negative integersnum1andnum2represented as strings, return the product ofnum1andnum2, also represented as a string.Note:You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.Example 1:Input:num1 = "2", num2 = "3"Output:"6"Example 2:Input:num1 = "123", num2 = "456"Output:"56088"Constraints:1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200num1andnum2consist of digits only.Bothnum1andnum2do not contain any leading zero, except the number0itself.
