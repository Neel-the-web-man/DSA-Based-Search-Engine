Theedit distancebetween two strings is the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.The allowed operations are:Add one character to the string.Remove one character from the string.Replace one character in the string.For example, the edit distance between LOVE and MOVIE is 2, because you can first replace L with M, and then add I.Your task is to calculate the edit distance between two strings.InputThe first input line has a string that containsnnncharacters between A–Z.The second input line has a string that containsmmmcharacters between A–Z.OutputPrint one integer: the edit distance between the strings.Constraints1≤n,m≤50001 \le n,m \le 50001≤n,m≤5000ExampleInput:LOVE
MOVIEOutput:2
