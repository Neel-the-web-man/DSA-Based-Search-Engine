You are given a0-indexedarray ofuniquestringswords.Apalindrome pairis a pair of integers(i, j)such that:0 <= i, j < words.length,i != j, andwords[i] + words[j](the concatenation of the two strings) is apalindrome.Returnan array of all thepalindrome pairsofwords.You must write an algorithm withO(sum of words[i].length)runtime complexity.Example 1:Input:words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]Output:[[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]Explanation:The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]Example 2:Input:words = ["bat","tab","cat"]Output:[[0,1],[1,0]]Explanation:The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]Example 3:Input:words = ["a",""]Output:[[0,1],[1,0]]Explanation:The palindromes are ["a","a"]Constraints:1 <= words.length <= 50000 <= words[i].length <= 300words[i]consists of lowercase English letters.
