A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected byexactlyone path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.Given a tree ofnnodes labelled from0ton - 1, and an array ofn - 1edgeswhereedges[i] = [ai, bi]indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodesaiandbiin the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a nodexas the root, the result tree has heighth. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e.min(h))  are calledminimum height trees(MHTs).Returna list of allMHTs'root labels. You can return the answer inany order.Theheightof a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.Example 1:Input:n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]Output:[1]Explanation:As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.Example 2:Input:n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]Output:[3,4]Constraints:1 <= n <= 2 * 104edges.length == n - 10 <= ai, bi< nai!= biAll the pairs(ai, bi)are distinct.The given input isguaranteedto be a tree and there will beno repeatededges.
