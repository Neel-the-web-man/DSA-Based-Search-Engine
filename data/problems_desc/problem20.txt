Given stringss1,s2, ands3, find whethers3is formed by aninterleavingofs1ands2.Aninterleavingof two stringssandtis a configuration wheresandtare divided intonandmsubstringsrespectively, such that:s = s1+ s2+ ... + snt = t1+ t2+ ... + tm|n - m| <= 1Theinterleavingiss1+ t1+ s2+ t2+ s3+ t3+ ...ort1+ s1+ t2+ s2+ t3+ s3+ ...Note:a + bis the concatenation of stringsaandb.Example 1:Input:s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"Output:trueExplanation:One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.Example 2:Input:s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"Output:falseExplanation:Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.Example 3:Input:s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""Output:trueConstraints:0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000 <= s3.length <= 200s1,s2, ands3consist of lowercase English letters.Follow up:Could you solve it using onlyO(s2.length)additional memory space?
