Given an integer, your task is to find the number, sum and product of its divisors. As an example, let us consider the number121212:the number of divisors is666(they are111,222,333,444,666,121212)the sum of divisors is1+2+3+4+6+12=281+2+3+4+6+12=281+2+3+4+6+12=28the product of divisors is1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅6⋅12=17281 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 12 = 17281⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅6⋅12=1728Since the input number may be large, it is given as a prime factorization.InputThe first line has an integernnn: the number of parts in the prime factorization.After this, there arennnlines that describe the factorization.
