There arennnapples with known weights. Your task is to divide the apples into two groups so that the difference between the weights of the groups is minimal.InputThe first input line has an integernnn: the number of apples.The next line hasnnnintegersp1,p2,…,pnp_1,p_2,\dots,p_np1​,p2​,…,pn​: the weight of each apple.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum difference between the weights of the groups.Constraints1≤n≤201 \le n \le 201≤n≤201≤pi≤1091 \le p_i \le 10^91≤pi​≤109ExampleInput:5
3 2 7 4 1Output:1Explanation: Group 1 has weights 2, 3 and 4 (total weight 9), and group 2 has weights 1 and 7 (total weight 8).
