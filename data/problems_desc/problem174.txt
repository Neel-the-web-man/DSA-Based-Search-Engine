Given an integer arraynums, returnan arrayanswersuch thatanswer[i]is equal to the product of all the elements ofnumsexceptnums[i].The product of any prefix or suffix ofnumsisguaranteedto fit in a32-bitinteger.You must write an algorithm that runs inO(n)time and without using the division operation.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,2,3,4]Output:[24,12,8,6]Example 2:Input:nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]Output:[0,0,9,0,0]Constraints:2 <= nums.length <= 105-30 <= nums[i] <= 30The input is generated such thatanswer[i]isguaranteedto fit in a32-bitinteger.Follow up:Can you solve the problem inO(1)extraÂ space complexity? (The output arraydoes notcount as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
