Given a1-indexedarray of integersnumbersthat is alreadysorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specifictargetnumber. Let these two numbers benumbers[index1]andnumbers[index2]where1 <= index1< index2<= numbers.length.Returnthe indices of the two numbers,index1andindex2,added by oneas an integer array[index1, index2]of length 2.The tests are generated such that there isexactly one solution. Youmay notuse the same element twice.Your solution must use only constant extra space.Example 1:Input:numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9Output:[1,2]Explanation:The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1= 1, index2= 2. We return [1, 2].Example 2:Input:numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6Output:[1,3]Explanation:The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1= 1, index2= 3. We return [1, 3].Example 3:Input:numbers = [-1,0], target = -1Output:[1,2]Explanation:The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1= 1, index2= 2. We return [1, 2].Constraints:2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000numbersis sorted innon-decreasing order.-1000 <= target <= 1000The tests are generated such that there isexactly one solution.
