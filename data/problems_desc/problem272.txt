There is a directed graph ofnnodes with each node labeled from0ton - 1. The graph is represented by a0-indexed2D integer arraygraphwheregraph[i]is an integer array of nodes adjacent to nodei, meaning there is an edge from nodeito each node ingraph[i].A node is aterminal nodeif there are no outgoing edges. A node is asafe nodeif every possible path starting from that node leads to aterminal node(or another safe node).Returnan array containing all thesafe nodesof the graph. The answer should be sorted inascendingorder.Example 1:Input:graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]Output:[2,4,5,6]Explanation:The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.Example 2:Input:graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]Output:[4]Explanation:Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.Constraints:n == graph.length1 <= n <= 1040 <= graph[i].length <= n0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1graph[i]is sorted in a strictly increasing order.The graph may contain self-loops.The number of edges in the graph will be in the range[1, 4 * 104].
