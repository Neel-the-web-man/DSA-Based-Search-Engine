A game hasnnnlevels, connected bymmmteleporters, and your task is to get from level111to levelnnn. The game has been designed so that there are no directed cycles in the underlying graph. In how many ways can you complete the game?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of levels and teleporters. The levels are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.After this, there aremmmlines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integersaaaandbbb: there is a teleporter from levelaaato levelbbb.OutputPrint one integer: the number of ways you can complete the game. Since the result may be large, print it modulo109+710^9+7109+7.Constraints1≤n≤1051 \le n \le 10^51≤n≤1051≤m≤2⋅1051 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤m≤2⋅1051≤a,b≤n1 \le a,b \le n1≤a,b≤nExampleInput:4 5
