You are given an integer arraycardswherecards[i]represents thevalueof theithcard. A pair of cards arematchingif the cards have thesamevalue.Returntheminimumnumber ofconsecutivecards you have to pick up to have a pair ofmatchingcards among the picked cards.If it is impossible to have matching cards, return-1.Example 1:Input:cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]Output:4Explanation:We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.Example 2:Input:cards = [1,0,5,3]Output:-1Explanation:There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.Constraints:1 <= cards.length <= 1050 <= cards[i] <= 106
