There arencities numbered from0ton - 1andn - 1roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.Roads are represented byconnectionswhereconnections[i] = [ai, bi]represents a road from cityaito citybi.This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city0), and many people want to travel to this city.Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city0. Return theminimumnumber of edges changed.It'sguaranteedthat each city can reach city0after reorder.Example 1:Input:n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]Output:3Explanation:Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).Example 2:Input:n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]Output:2Explanation:Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).Example 3:Input:n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]Output:0Constraints:2 <= n <= 5 * 104connections.length == n - 1connections[i].length == 20 <= ai, bi<= n - 1ai!= bi
