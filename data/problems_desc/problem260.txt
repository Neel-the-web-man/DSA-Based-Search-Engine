Given anm x nintegersmatrix, returnthe length of the longest increasing path inmatrix.From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. Youmay notmovediagonallyor moveoutside the boundary(i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).Example 1:Input:matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]Output:4Explanation:The longest increasing path is[1, 2, 6, 9].Example 2:Input:matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]Output:4Explanation:The longest increasing path is[3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.Example 3:Input:matrix = [[1]]Output:1Constraints:m == matrix.lengthn == matrix[i].length1 <= m, n <= 2000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231- 1
