Consider a two player game where each player hasnnncards numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n. On each turn both players place one of their cards on the table. The player who placed the higher card gets one point. If the cards are equal, neither player gets a point. The game continues until all cards have been played.You are given the number of cardsnnnand the players' scores at the end of the game,aaaandbbb. Your task is to count the number of possible games with that outcome.InputThe first line contains one integerttt: the number of tests.Then there aretttlines, each with three integersnnn,aaaandbbb.OutputFor each test case print the number of possible games modulo109+710^9+7109+7.Constraints1≤t≤10001 \le t \le 10001≤t≤10001≤n≤50001 \le n \le 50001≤n≤50000≤a,b≤n0 \le a,b \le n0≤a,b≤nExampleInput:5
