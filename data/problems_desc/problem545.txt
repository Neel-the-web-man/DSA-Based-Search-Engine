You are given an integer arrayarr.We splitarrinto some number ofchunks(i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.Returnthe largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.Example 1:Input:arr = [5,4,3,2,1]Output:1Explanation:Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.Example 2:Input:arr = [2,1,3,4,4]Output:4Explanation:We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.Constraints:1 <= arr.length <= 20000 <= arr[i] <= 108
