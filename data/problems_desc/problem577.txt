You are givennitem's value and label as two integer arraysvaluesandlabels. You are also given two integersnumWantedanduseLimit.Your task is to find a subset of items with themaximum sumof their values such that:The number of items isat mostnumWanted.The number of items with the same label isat mostuseLimit.Return the maximum sum.Example 1:Input:values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1Output:9Explanation:The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth items with the sum of values 5 + 3 + 1.Example 2:Input:values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 2Output:12Explanation:The subset chosen is the first, second, and third items with the sum of values 5 + 4 + 3.Example 3:Input:values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1Output:16Explanation:The subset chosen is the first and fourth items with the sum of values 9 + 7.Constraints:n == values.length == labels.length1 <= n <= 2 * 1040 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 2 * 1041 <= numWanted, useLimit <= n
