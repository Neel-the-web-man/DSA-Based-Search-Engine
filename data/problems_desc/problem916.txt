A directed acyclic graph consists ofnnnnodes andmmmedges. The nodes are numbered1,2,…,n1,2,\dots,n1,2,…,n.Calculate for each node the number of nodes you can reach from that node (including the node itself).InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandmmm: the number of nodes and edges.Then there aremmmlines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integersaaaandbbb: there is an edge from nodeaaato nodebbb.OutputPrintnnnintegers: for each node the number of reachable nodes.Constraints1≤n≤5⋅1041 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^41≤n≤5⋅1041≤m≤1051 \le m \le 10^51≤m≤105ExampleInput:5 6
