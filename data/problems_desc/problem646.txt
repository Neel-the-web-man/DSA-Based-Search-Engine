Thecomplementof an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the0's to1's and all the1's to0's in its binary representation.For example, The integer5is"101"in binary and itscomplementis"010"which is the integer2.Given an integern, returnits complement.Example 1:Input:n = 5Output:2Explanation:5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.Example 2:Input:n = 7Output:0Explanation:7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.Example 3:Input:n = 10Output:5Explanation:10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.Constraints:0 <= n < 109Note:This question is the same as 476:https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/
