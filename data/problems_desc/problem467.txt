You are given an integer array,nums, and an integerk.numscomprises of only0's and1's. In one move, you can choose twoadjacentindices and swap their values.Returntheminimumnumber of moves required so thatnumshaskconsecutive1's.Example 1:Input:nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2Output:1Explanation:In 1 move, nums could be [1,0,0,0,1,1] and have 2 consecutive 1's.Example 2:Input:nums = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1], k = 3Output:5Explanation:In 5 moves, the leftmost 1 can be shifted right until nums = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1].Example 3:Input:nums = [1,1,0,1], k = 2Output:0Explanation:nums already has 2 consecutive 1's.Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 105nums[i]is0or1.1 <= k <= sum(nums)
