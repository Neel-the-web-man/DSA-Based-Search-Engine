You are playing a game that consists ofnnnlevels. Each level has a monster. On levels1,2,…,n−11,2,\dots,n-11,2,…,n−1, you can either kill or escape the monster. However, on levelnnnyou must kill the final monster to win the game.Killing a monster takessfsfsftime wheresssis the monster's strength andfffis your skill factor. After killing a monster, you get a new skill factor  (lower skill factor is better). What is the minimum total time in which you can win the game?InputThe first input line has two integersnnnandxxx: the number of levels and your initial skill factor.The second line hasnnnintegerss1,s2,…,sns_1,s_2,\dots,s_ns1​,s2​,…,sn​: each monster's strength.The third line hasnnnintegersf1,f2,…,fnf_1,f_2,\dots,f_nf1​,f2​,…,fn​: your new skill factor after killing a monster.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum total time to win the game.Constraints1≤n≤2⋅1051 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^51≤n≤2⋅1051≤x≤1061 \le x \le 10^61≤x≤1061≤si,fi≤1061 \le s_i, f_i \le 10^61≤si​,fi​≤106ExampleInput:5 100
