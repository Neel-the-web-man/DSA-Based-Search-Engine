You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.Suppose you havenversions[1, 2, ..., n]and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.You are given an APIbool isBadVersion(version)which returns whetherversionis bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.Example 1:Input:n = 5, bad = 4Output:4Explanation:call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.Example 2:Input:n = 1, bad = 1Output:1Constraints:1 <= bad <= n <= 231- 1
